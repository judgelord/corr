Replication code for "The Effects of Shifting Priorities and Capacity on Congressional Policy Work and Constituency Service: Evidence from a Census of Legislator Requests to U.S. Federal Agencies"

## Data files: 

###  The main replication data 

1. Counts of legislator contacts per year per agency: "data/corr_counts.Rdata" (on dataverse)

### Required data on members of Congress

2. legislator covariates: "data/member_data.rda" including 

- year, chamber, and party retrieved from voteview.com (also available on dataverse)

- committee positions from @StewartWoon2017 and @unitedstates


## Code files

1. "docs/replication.qmd" uses `corr_counts` and `member data` to reproduce all analyses in the paper and Supplemental Information (rendered [here](https://judgelord.github.io/corr/replication))
2. "docs/descriptives.qmd" uses `corr_counts` and `member_data` to produce all descriptive figures in the paper (rendered [here](https://judgelord.github.io/corr/descriptives))
