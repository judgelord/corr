\section{FOIA Data}

Our data represent a near census of requests to federal departments, agencies, and sub-agencies. We received records from every department other than the Department of State,\footnote{The Department of State has a notorious FOIA backlog of approximately 10,500 cases. The FOIA office expects to fill our May 2018 request in 2024.} 
and most independent agencies, commissions, boards, executive offices (e.g., the Council on Environmental Quality and U.S. Trade Representative), and pseudo-governmental institutions like Amtrak and the US Export-Import Bank. 

\paragraph{Variation in Responses to Identical FOIA Request} Responses to our FOIA requests varied significantly. Most agencies offered logs of congressional correspondence, which record a date, sender, summary of the request, and other information used by agency staff to process and respond to requests. Logs generally include any written requests, as well as many phone and email records. For example, between May 2015 and December 2017, the Department of Justice Office of Administrative Law Judges received 132 emails, 109 telephone calls, and only 54 letters. Between 2007 and 2017, the Postal Regulatory Commission received 100 emails, 30 faxes, 173 letters, and 118 calls. In this paper, we use ``contacts'' and ``letters'' interchangeably to refer to all modes of correspondence. 

Small agencies and regional offices had staff search their email history or provided hand-written records, which we then transcribed. Department Secretary offices generally queried a correspondence tracking database designed to track all correspondence. Still, our FOIA requests to sub-departmental components almost always recovered additional congressional correspondence records missing from central databases. As one central office FOIA officer put it, ``Legislative Affairs is supposed to be the front door for the department, but if somebody knows somebody, well...'' (personal communication, February 21, 2018). Because of such idiosyncratic relationships, capturing correspondence patterns that ``go around'' a Department Secretary's office is key to avoiding erroneous inferences about legislator behavior. For example, when chairs of the Homeland Security committee wrote about immigration enforcement issues, they almost always contacted the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) office of the Executive Secretary, but, at the same time, the Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) component of DHS directly received thousands of requests from a different set of legislators. Our systematic data collection ensures that we capture the totality of legislators' behavior.

\section{Contact Codebook} \label{a:codebook}
\singlespacing
%%% Note: From Ellie. I deleted everything here that we're not using in this paper.  

We provide the following codebook to a team of hand-coders to code each case of Congressional contact with federal agencies and extract information about the legislator. The codebook provides a series of steps to move from raw correspondence logs to data formatted for our analysis.  We also developed subagency-specific coding rules throughout the hand-coding process where certain regular expressions indicated certain types of requests. For example, where documents containing the word ``rulemaking" consistently indicated that a legislator's request involved an agency's proposed rule, we assigned all observations containing the word ``rulemaking" yet uncoded by hand to the ``Policy-Rulemaking" category.\footnote{Hundreds of scripts for processing the raw data from each agency and applying any inductively-generated regular-expression-based coding are available on our GitHub, along with each script's full revision history and all written communication with RAs about processing and coding these data.}

We classify legislator requests into five categories: ``Individual Constituent Service'' (i.e., individual casework or advocacy on behalf of a group such as employees of a company), ``Nonprofit or Local Government Constituent Service'' (e.g., help with a grant application), ``Corporate Constituent Service'' (e.g., help with a specific government contract), ``Corporate Policy'' (policy work explicitly aimed to benefit a specific industry, like tariffs and subsidies), and ``General Policy'' (broader policy work related to legislation, budgets, or rulemaking). We define constituents broadly such that they need not be in a member's district. For example, Representative Tauscher of Wisconsin wrote to the Defense Commissary Agency on behalf of the Jelly Belly Candy Co., based in California. Jelly Belly was then ``given a chance to resolve issues" with their contract. We coded this case as ``Corporate Constituent Service,'' part of our broader measure of constituent service. We also consider constituent service as broader than individual casework. For example, we coded Senator Rubio asking the IRS for special treatment for residents of hurricane-affected parts of Florida as ``Individual Constituent Service.'' We note these ``hard cases'' to illustrate the boundaries of our coding scheme. Most contacts were easily parsed into either individual casework or policy work related to hearings, regulations, and legislation.

\subsection{Congressional Correspondence Log Coding Guidelines}

The first step is to identify the columns that contain the member of Congress (or Committee), the date that the member-initiated correspondence, and the column that best describes the subject. These should be named FROM, DATE, and SUBJECT. 

We aim to classify the subject of correspondence between members of Congress and government agencies. You can do this using keywords (potential keywords in italics below) but may also require googling subject lines (e.g., what does this acronym mean in this context!?) and inferring why the legislator made the request. Doing so may require identifying a member's relevant policy positions. For example, if the subject is "mining regulations" or "open internet," a member's voting history on related bills or donations from the industry may help us infer if the letter was policy work on behalf of the industry (type 4) or not (type 5). Limiting your search to a date range around the letter date may yield relevant public statements. If you have questions, find something interesting, or, in your efforts to classify a confusing correspondence, you discover information like a related public statement, note it in the NOTES column. In some cases, columns other than the SUBJECT may offer helpful information. This may be difficult at first but will get easier. \\

The outcome is a spreadsheet with the first columns being FROM, DATE, SUBJECT, TYPE, CERTAINTY, ALT\_TYPE.\\


Below are five potential codes for the TYPE and three potential codes for your level of CERTAINTY that it is this type. If you are less than Very Certain (i.e., if only Fairly Certain, or Toss Up), also record your second best guess as ALT\_TYPE; otherwise, leave this column blank. Only leave NOTES if you think it would be helpful for the team to revisit the entry.

\subsubsection{TYPE}

1 = Personal Service\\

\hfill\begin{minipage}{\dimexpr\textwidth-2cm}

\section{Additional Models} \label{s:appendix_models}

\subsection{Interpreting Experence Effects }

In section we draw inferences about the effects of legislator expiernce from within-district design, showing that new legislators provide less constituency service. The within-legislator design show results consistant with this conclusion. However, we interpret indicator variables for years of expiernce in the witin-legislator design with caution given the complexity of this model with time shocks and expiernce increasing in time, which has the potential to cause idenification issues in the interpretion of the estimates for years of expierence. Not that including years of expiernece as a control is appropriate and importatant for correctly chair effects, which are clearly identified in these models.  

We estimate that the experience gained between the first and second year in Congress causes an increase of 0.24 requests \textit{per agency}. The experience gained between the first and seventh years causes an increase of 0.51 per agency. Across all 90 agencies in these data, this represents an increase of approximately 46 additional requests per year, 45.5\% of the average number of requests per year in our data. There is a smaller increase after the second year. The experience gained between the second and seventh year causes an increase of 0.28 per agency, an increase of approximately 25 additional requests per year, 24.5\% of the average number of requests per year in our data.

\includegraphics[width = .8\textwidth]{figs/m-total-predicted-4}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{f:m-total-predicted-time} shows the predicted total number of letters in Congress and committee chair status (comparing predictions for counterfactuals where the same legislator did and did not receive a chairmanship in their sixth year).\footnote{Predictions are based on a legislator-agency pair where (1) the legislators' average annual contacts equaled the overall average, (2) the legislators' number of contacts with the agency equal the average received by that agency, (3) and the agency received an average number of letters.} 

If we interpret this atertaive measure of expierndce as identified, it shows further suppoert for the conclusions of the within-distirct models. In their first year, legislators make significantly fewer requests to agencies than they do in the following year. Subsequent increases are less significant.  


\subsection{Constituency Service Only}

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{center}

\footnotetext{This table shows how the number of contacts hand-coded as constituecy service changes as legislators acquire more expiernece and power in Congress. Column 1 shows the average differences across committee assignments and years in Congress. Column 2 presents the difference-in-differences estimates. Column 3 subsets to legislators who serve at least 3 years in Congress. Column 4 takes the Log of the counts + 1 as the dependent variable.}
\end{minipage}
\end{table}

Table \ref{t:models_con} is identical to Table \ref{t:models_total} except that we subset the data to only legislator requests hand-coded as constituency service. 
Model 2 (Column 2 of Table \ref{t:models_con} and Figure \ref{f:m-con-predicted}) provide the estimated effects from the difference-in-differences specification in Equation \ref{e:diff1}. More experience increases the level of constituency service that legislators provide. The effect of being a committee chair is positive but not significant at the .05 level. We estimate that the experience gained between the first and second year in Congress causes an increase of 0.15 requests \textit{per agency}. The experience gained between the first and seventh years causes an increase of 0.28 per agency. Across all 90 agencies, this represents an increase of approximately 25 additional requests per year, 38.6\% of the average number of requests per year in our data. There is a smaller increase after the second year. The experience gained between the second and seventh year causes an increase of 0.13 per agency, an increase of approximately 12 additional requests per year, 38.6\% of the average number of requests per year in our data.

Column 3 subsets to legislators who serve at least 3 years in Congress. Column 4 takes the Log of the counts + 1 as the dependent variable.}
\end{minipage}
\end{table}


Table \ref{t:models_policy} is identical to Table \ref{t:models_total} except that we subset the data to only legislator requests hand-coded as policy work. 
Column 2 of Table \ref{t:models_policy} and Figure \ref{f:m-policy-predicted}) provide the estimated effects from the difference-in-differences specification in Equation \ref{e:diff1}. Across all measures of institutional power, we find that more power increases the level of policy work that legislators provide. Consider first the effect of being a committee chair. We estimate that becoming a committee chair causes an increase of 0.16 policy requests \textit{per agency} (95-percent confidence interval [0.09, 0.22]). Across all 90 agencies, this represents an increase of approximately 14 additional requests per year, 92.6\% of the average number of requests per year in our data. There is a smaller increase for individuals who become ranking members and those who join a Prestige Committee, though the increase is statistically significant for the prestige committee. Becoming a ranking member of a committee causes an increase of 0.09 contacts per agency while joining a prestige committee causes a 0.16 per agency increase in the number of contacts a member of Congress makes.
