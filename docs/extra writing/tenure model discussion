% To test this hypothesis, we use a similar empirical approach in the previous section but now focus on the first years of an individual's service in Washington. Specifically, we estimate a difference-in-differences regression of the form: 

% \begin{eqnarray}
% Y_{ijt} & = & \sum_{s=1}^{6} \beta_{s} \text{tenure}_{s[it]} + \gamma_{ij} + \delta_{t} + m_{it} + p_{it} + \epsilon_{ijt} \label{e:diff2}
% \end{eqnarray} 

% where we include fixed effects for each legislator-agency pair ($\gamma_{ij}$), a time fixed effect ($\delta_{t}$), and indicators for a legislator's status in the majority ($m_{it}$) or in the president's party ($p_{it}$).  


%We are interested in both the size of these coefficients--which inform how legislators' provision of constituency service compares to legislators who have remained in office longer than seven years---and comparisons across the coefficients---which describe how the provision of constituency service changes over the first six years in office. Our comparisons across these first years do not depend on how many years we include in the analysis. But the ``reference" category can lead to slightly different conclusions about the level of service that new legislators provide compared to more experienced members. This section focuses on these first years because this is the time frame for many term limit proposals. Further, this is the range where we have the best evidence for the year-to-year shifts in how legislators provide service. The restriction in Equation \ref{e:diff2} is not consequential for the conclusions that we reach. We show in Appendix ZZ that the main patterns that we uncover are consistent regardless of how many years we include in our analysis. And as we show in section YY, we find similar patterns when examining what occurs after a new legislator takes office. 

%The first column of Table \ref{t:tenure1} is a cross-sectional regression that compares the provision of constituency service across legislators' first six years in Congress while also including indicators for a legislator's majority party status and whether they are members of the president's party. This regression shows that new legislators provide substantially lower levels of constituency service than their colleagues in their second year of service in Congress: legislators in their first year make about 0.135 fewer constituency service requests per agency than legislators in their second year and 0.2 fewer requests than legislators in their third year. Across all six years, we find that newer legislators are, on average, making fewer contacts with federal agencies than their more experienced colleagues.
