Let's do this in an outline


We provide direct evidence of how elected officials could use constituency service to build an incumbency advantage. While there is a large literature that argues constituency service is a key component of representation and an important component of the incumbency advantage, no study has documented that current legislators hold an advantage over new legislators or that as legislators acquire more resources they are able to provide more service.  To test whether existing legislators hold an advantage, we assemble a massive new database of over 319,790 Congressional requests to agencies between 2007 and 2018 obtained through over YYY FOIA requests, a near census of constituency service requests. We show that there is a decrease in the number of constituency service requests during the first two years of a newly elected members' term, but then the difference declines.  Further, as legislators are promoted in the institution we see no decrease in service provide and often an increase in services.  Taken together, we show evidence that as legislators acquire expertise and resources in the institution they use these to create an advantage in the direct benefits they provide constituents. 


Name recognition data.  How much does it increase in year 2?  
What happens to name recognition at the state level?

Reasons that we can control for. Wave election, dem election, demographic change.  
Measure of who is voting---individualized---actually bad--people lost because they're bad.

Walk through in a conceptual standpoint how the diff and diff addresses demand side issues. 
More brutally clear and conceptual with all the different implications. 
In terms of people who are misunderstanding what we're doing.  

take subanalysis---here is a deep dive where there should be differences and SSA.  And age.
