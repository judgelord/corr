 When elected officials gain power, do they use it to provide more constituent service or affect policy? The answer informs debates over how legislator capacity, term limits, and institutional positions affect representation.  We distinguish two countervailing effects of increased institutional power: shifting priorities and increased capacity.  To assess how institutional power shapes behavior, we assemble a massive new database of `{r} readLines(here::here("docs", "tables", "n2007-2020"))` legislator requests to a near census of federal departments, agencies, and sub-agencies between 2007 and 2020. We find that legislators prioritize policy work as they gain institutional power (e.g., become a committee chair) but simultaneously maintain their levels of constituency service. Moreover, when a new legislator replaces an experienced legislator, the district receives less constituency service *and* less policy work. Rather than long-serving and powerful elected officials diverting attention from constituents, their increased capacity enables them to maintain levels of constituency service, even as they prioritize policy work.

# Introduction

One of the oldest traditions of representation in American politics is
constituency service--how members of Congress help channel and
articulate the demands of individuals, groups, and localities to the
federal government [@Fenno1978]. Advocating on behalf of their
constituents to federal agencies is a crucial part of a modern
legislator's job, and its growth has been used to explain the incumbency
advantage [@King1991]. Yet, despite the centrality of constituency
service in theories of congressional representation, constituency
service remains one of the least understood congressional activities.

This paper examines how increasing power affects the provision of
constituency service. On the one hand, institutional power may enable
legislators to provide more constituency service. Formal models of
accountability imply that if constituency service enables elected
officials to demonstrate competence to their constituents, then
increased institutional power and capacity will result in more
constituency service effort to secure reelection
[@AshworthBuenodeMesquita2006]. Experienced incumbents may also have an
advantage over challengers if newly elected officials incur start-up
costs that reduce their capacity to provide constituency service.

On the other hand, we might expect that as legislators spend more time
in Washington and gain prestige, they become more focused on general
policy work and less attentive to their district and constituents. This
dynamic is central to theories of representation that examine the
trade-offs legislators face in their careers. Many assume that the
effect of shifting priorities is large enough to cause long-serving
legislators to catch "Potomac fever" and devote less attention to
constituents back in their district [@Fenno1978]. Such reasoning is the
primary justification for term limits. Related arguments are common in
the popular press [@Edwards2005] and evoked in rallying cries to "drain
the swamp" of legislators focused on Washington politics
[@Rosenblatt2016].

We test these competing expectations with a massive new dataset of
constituency service and policy work: a near census of legislator
contacts with federal agencies from 2007 to 2020. Recent work using data
on congressional correspondence has yielded important findings regarding
the policy strategies of cross-pressured legislators [@Ritchie2017],
distributive politics [@MillsKalafHuges2015], and the role of ideology
in congressional oversight [@Lowande2018JOP]. Except for work by
@LowandeRitchieLauterbach2018 on descriptive representation, this
emerging scholarship has focused on policy work (not constituency
service). Adding to this work, our theory and research design focus on
simultaneous shifts in constituency service and policy work.

Given the difficulty in collecting these data, previous work has been
restricted to small subsets of agencies and, thus, a small subset of
policy domains. Our larger dataset enables us to comprehensively test
how the behavior of legislators shifts as they gain institutional power
and ensures that our conclusions are not limited to subsets of the
executive branch.

To assess absolute and relative shifts in legislator contacts to
agencies, we hand code the content of
`{r} readLines(here::here("docs", "tables", "n2007-2020coded"))`
requests as policy work or constituency service. Doing so also yields
many illuminating descriptives about modern congressional
representation. For example, over 80% of contacts are made on behalf of
constituents, and less than 20% are focused on policy work.

We find evidence for both of the countervailing effects of institutional
power that we theorize, supporting both the *increased capacity theory*
and the *shifting priorities theory* of representation. Critically, the
magnitude of the effect of increasing capacity on constituency service
offsets the effect of shifting priorities toward policy work. Thus, the
amount of constituency service remains constant even though legislators'
attention shifts towards policy as they gain power in Washington.
Constituents do not face a trade-off between powerful and attentive
representatives.

These findings are robust; they are not the result of exogenous
variation in constituent demand, differences across districts, or
differences across legislators. Our research designs limit the influence
of any potential variation in constituent demand by leveraging
within-legislator and within-district comparisons. Moreover, through a
series of robustness checks and additional analyses, we find no evidence
that constituents shift demands to more established offices when a new
representative is elected. When House members lose an election, there is
no corresponding increase in constituency service requests from the
state's Senate delegation.

While this study does not aim to examine the effects of institutional
reforms, our results have implications for debates over congressional
staffing and term limits. Advocates for increasing congressional
staffing have long argued that declining capacity has hamstrung Congress
[@Reynolds2020]. Consistent with these arguments, we show that
legislators with access to more staff resources do more policy work.
Advocates for term limits assert that powerful career politicians become
alienated from their constituents. We show, however, that even as
legislators gain power, they remain focused on providing constituency
service. In fact---in contrast to arguments from term limit
supporters---the biggest decrease in constituency service occurs when a
new legislator replaces an experienced legislator. Our findings imply
that the turnover that term limits induce would cause a sharp decrease
in the volume of work from legislative offices.

We proceed as follows. @sec-theory explains divergent predictions about
how institutional position and tenure will affect legislators' behavior.
@sec-data explains our data collection process and summary statistics.
@sec-results shows that as legislators gain experience and institutional
power, they maintain or increase their levels of constituency service,
even as they shift their priorities toward policy work. @sec-demand
provides robustness checks for our results and explores alternative
explanations. @sec-discussion and @sec-conclude highlight implications
of these findings for theories of legislative behavior and institutional
reform debates.

# Do Experience and Power Increase or Decrease Constituency Service? {#sec-theory}

How elected officials balance their work on broad policy goals and
delivering particularistic service to their constituents and district
presents a significant tension for representation. Building on
multi-task models of representation [@AshworthBuenodeMesquita2006;
@gordon2009advantages], we explain why increased experience and power
may either increase or decrease the levels of constituency service
legislators provide depending on the relative magnitudes of the effects
of increasing capacity and changing priorities.

## Increasing Capacity Hypothesis: Why Experience and Power Could Increase Constituency Service

As elected officials garner more experience in Congress, one prediction
from formal models of accountability is that legislators will provide
more constituency service because their capacity to do so increases. An
influential set of formal theory papers argue that voters are
fundamentally engaged in a screening task: attempting to identify
elected officials who are competent and effectively deliver
representation to the district [@AshworthBuenodeMesquita2006;
@gordon2009advantages]. Under this model of representation, constituency
service helps reelection-minded legislators increase their chance of
reelection if they can exceed constituents' expectations of the level of
service that another candidate would provide. These models predict that
as a legislator's resources and capacity increase, they will increase
their level of constituency service [@AshworthBuenodeMesquita2006
Proposition 1].

Critically, constituents' demands for service do not go away. Even if
constituents value their representative's power over policy, they still
expect their elected officials to be attentive to the district.
Moreover, if constituency service helps with reelection, legislators may
invest in *creating* demands (for example, by advertising constituency
services) that they can then meet.

Research suggests that the low level of congressional capacity in the
modern Congress serves as a major constraint on Congress's ability to
function [@LaPira2020]. Experience in office and institutional power may
increase an individual legislator's capacity in many ways. Because many
of these mechanisms are observationally equivalent, we focus on capacity
in general and three general mechanisms by which experience and
institutional power may affect behavior: 1) increased resources, 2)
increased organizational capacity, and 3) an increased likelihood of
success when making a request.

### Mechanism 1: Increased Resources

As legislators acquire more institutional power, they usually gain more
resources. For example, becoming chair of a Congressional committee
provides legislators with a better ability to direct committee staff and
a larger budget. New committee chairs often bring in new staff who are
loyal to their priorities [@Fox1977; @DeGregorio1995]. Staff provide
legislators with the capacity to accomplish their goals
[@DeGregorio1994; @Hall1996; @HertelFernandez2019; @MontgomeryNyhan2017;
@McCrain2018; @CrossonEtAl2020; @Reynolds2020] and may counteract the
power of lobbyists [@HallDeardorff2006]. Even if committee resources are
earmarked for policy work, they can still increase a chair's capacity
for constituency service if using committee resources for policy work
frees up their personal office resources for constituency service.

### Mechanism 2: Increased Organizational Efficiency

Better organized legislator offices are more able to help constituents
navigate the federal bureaucracy. On average, experienced legislators
should have better systems that allow them to make more constituency
service requests than new legislators, who face "start-up" costs that
decrease the number of requests they make to agencies. Newly-elected
must hire staff, open district offices, and establish protocols,
priorities, and procedures in their office for handling constituency
service requests. They also lack the standard procedures that more
established offices use to handle particular problems efficiently. In
terms of formal models, office organization increases legislators'
capacity [@AshworthBuenodeMesquita2006]. As legislators build an office
and establish protocols, these start-up costs should subside as
legislators use the resources of their office more efficiently. For
example, @Cottle2022 finds that more experienced legislators and senior
staff are more productive. As a result, we expect new legislators to
make fewer requests, but only for the time it takes to establish their
office organization.

### Mechanism 3: Increased Likelihood of Success

In fulfilling statutory missions, agencies must prioritize resources and
use broad discretion in processing visa, permit, and grant applications,
regulating private entities' compliance with environmental, health, and
labor laws, and much more. Legislators are in a position to influence
these decisions. As public servants, agency staff may assign special
importance to elected officials' requests. For example, bureaucrats
often tag congressional correspondence as "VIP," and agency protocols
often require faster response deadlines and higher signature levels for
them. Bureaucrats have incentives to build relationships and reputations
that enhance their standing among members of Congress and those who have
their ear, and they actively do so [@Carpenter2001]. In short, complying
with legislator requests may help agencies achieve their own goals. If
an agency aims to grow its coalition of political supporters, we expect
them to accommodate congressional requests frequently.

As legislators become more powerful, agencies may be more responsive.
More powerful legislators can more easily alter an agency's budget or
create additional work through Congressional hearings. As a result,
agencies may prioritize requests from more powerful members of Congress.
For example, @Lowande2018JOP finds that agencies systematically
prioritize the requests of majority party legislators.
@MillsKalafHuges2015 find that the Federal Aviation Administration was
more likely to grant the requests of senior members of Congress.[^1] A
related literature similarly finds that seniority and committee
membership affect the distributive politics of earmarks [@Lazarus2010].
Increased marginal returns may incentivize more powerful legislators to
make more requests [@CainFerejohnFiorina1987].

[^1]: Because we are studying legislator behavior rather than agency
    behavior, this mechanism only requires that more powerful
    legislators occasionally believe that they are more likely to get a
    response. Regarding agency behavior, there is active scholarly
    debate over whether agencies respond differently to more powerful
    legislators. In contrast to canonical theories set out by
    @Arnold1979, @BerryBurdenHowell09 find no evidence that committee
    membership shaped the distribution of executive-branch spending.
    @RitchieYou2018 find that legislator requests influenced Department
    of Labor decisions, but notably, this influence was not correlated
    with oversight committee membership. Likewise, @MillsKalafHuges2015
    even find that the Federal Aviation Administration was *less* likely
    to grant the requests of members of their authorizing committee,
    which they attribute to the agency punishing committee members for
    recent budget cuts.

Because this third mechanism operates as a multiplier on institutional
power and organizational capacity, it is observationally equivalent to
the first two mechanisms for our analysis. In short, the observable
implications of theories emphasizing the effects of capacity and
resources are that legislators with more experience and more powerful
institutional positions like committee chairs will do more constituency
service work.

## Shifting Priorities Hypothesis: Why Experience and Power Could Decrease Legislators' Constituency Service Efforts

A different set of expectations for how legislator behavior may change
in response to increased experience and power is present in the
political science literature on Congressional careers tracing back to
@Fenno1973. Legislators do not only care about reelection; they also
have policy goals. As @ButlerKarpowitzPope2012 [p. 475] conclude, "The
service-policy divide is thus an important theoretical lens through
which legislative behavior can be viewed." As legislators gain
experience and power, the marginal impact of the resources they allocate
to policy work increases. Powerful legislators thus have incentives to
shift their attention to policy work. If this theory is right, as
legislators gain power and experience, they should increase the ratio of
policy work to constituency service.

As legislators spend more time in Washington, they may become detached
and alienated from their district. @Fenno1978 documents that some
members of Congress catch "Potomac fever." Different institutional
positions allow legislators to advance different goals [@Fenno1973]. As
legislators spend more time in office and attain more influential
institutional roles, legislators might focus on policy priorities and
less on the particular demands of their constituents. While newly
elected officials may remain primarily focused on reelection,
longer-serving officials may prioritize other goals.

If the shifting priorities hypothesis is right---that legislators shift
attention from their district to policy work---we expect that
legislators provide *relatively less* constituent service compared to
policy work as they gain experience and power. The "Potomac fever"
concern is that, as legislators gain experience and power, the magnitude
of the effect of shifting attention and priorities toward policy work is
large enough to swamp any increase in capacity. If this strong ("Potomac
fever") version of the shifting priorities hypothesis is true, we should
find that legislators provide *less* constituent service in absolute
terms.

A parallel argument about legislator behavior is the foundation of
arguments for institutional reforms, particularly arguments for term
limits. For example, during a 2019 Senate committee hearing, Senator Ted
Cruz (R-TX) argued in favor of term limits by stating that at our
nation's founding, politicians traveled to Washington to serve in
Congress "for a time but usually returned to their homes and their
affairs," while today, "far too many of our politicians come to
Washington to stay," [@termlimit2019].

Formal models of representation predict that as legislators prioritize
policy work in Washington, the ratio of policy work to constituency
service will increase. All else equal, they will then provide lower
levels of constituency service to their district. In the model in
[@AshworthBuenodeMesquita2006], this would occur as legislators place a
lower priority on constituency service. If legislators' priorities shift
over their careers or as they gain power, more experienced and powerful
legislators will allocate their staff to policy work over constituency
service. Likewise, if members shift their *attention* from their
district to their career in Washington (in Congress or after), their
relative level of attention to constituent issues will decrease.

## The Countervailing Effects of Increasing Capacity and Shifting Priorities on Constituency Service

The increased capacity and shifting priorities hypotheses are not
mutually exclusive. Legislators' career shifts may simultaneously
increase their resources and decrease their relative priority on
constituency service. The net effect of these countervailing shifts on
the levels of constituency service they provide thus depends on the
*relative* magnitude of legislators' capacity increase compared to the
magnitude of their shift in priorities. Increased capacity may offset a
*relative* shift away from constituency service as a legislator gains
power. If this occurs, we expect the absolute level of constituency
service to stay the same or increase as legislators gain experience and
power, even as their ratio of policy work to constituent service
increases. Alternatively, if the effect of increased capacity is
relatively small or the effect of shifting priorities relatively large,
absolute levels of constituency service may decline as a legislator
gains power.

@tbl-theory and @fig-2x2 show potential changes in the absolute volume
of constituency service and the ratio of policy work to constituency
service due to *changes in capacity* and *shifting priorities*. The
top-left cell of @tbl-theory shows our expectations if both mechanisms
affect behavior *and* the magnitude of the effect of increased capacity
is large enough to overcome the countervailing effect of shifting
priorities (any outcome in the upper, darker-shaded region of @fig-2x2,
Subfigure (d), including the scenario shown in Subfigure (c)).

@fig-2x2 formalizes the potential outcomes implied by our theory to
clarify the conditions under which constituency service will increase or
decrease as an elected official's capacity and priorities change. For
simplicity, @fig-2x2 assumes a baseline capacity of 100 (e.g., 100
contacts with federal agencies per year) and a baseline ratio of
constituency service to policy work of 80:20 (80% constituency service).
It visualizes potential outcomes for changes in capacity extending up to
150% of some baseline level of capacity. The level of policy work, $x$,
done by an elected official, $i$, depends on their overall capacity,
$c$, and relative priority for constituency service versus policy work,
$p \in [0, 1]$ (that is, the share of contacts that are constituency
service rather than policy work) such that $x_i = c_i (1-p_i)$. An
elected official's level of constituency service, $y_i$, likewise
depends on their overall capacity and priorities such that
$y_i = c_i p_i$. For any given level of capacity, $y_i = c_i-x_i$
specifies a line of possible divisions of capacity between policy work
and constituency service. Increasing capacity pushes this "capacity
frontier" line to the upper right (@fig-2x2, Subfigure (a)). Where on
this line a legislator exists at any point in time depends on their
relative priority for policy work and constituency service (@fig-2x2,
Subfigure (b)). If capacity and priorities shift simultaneously,
priorities can shift toward policy while levels of constituency service
are maintained or even increase (@fig-2x2, Subfigure (c)). The relative
magnitude of these two effects determines whether constituency service
will increase or decrease (@fig-2x2, Subfigure (d)). When
$c_{i1}p_{i1} > c_{i2}p_{i2}$, constituency service decreases between
time 1 and time 2. When $c_{i1}p_{i1} < c_{i2}p_{i2}$ constituency
service increases. When $c_{i1}p_{i1} = c_{i2}p_{i2}$, there is no
change in constituency service.

## Alternative Explanation for Changes in Constituency Service: Constituent Demand

We aim to understand how gaining power and experience in Washington
affects how legislators serve constituents. But often, legislators
depend on constituents to ask for help navigating the federal
bureaucracy. An alternative explanation for why legislators' rates of
constituency service provision vary is that they receive differing
numbers of requests from their constituents for reasons that are not a
result of legislators' capacity and experience. While such variation in
constituent demand is substantively interesting, such an explanation for
constituency service provision does not inform debates about the extent
to which legislators' capacity and priorities change with their time in
office and institutional position.

Of course, constituent demands inform which agencies legislators
contact. For example, some districts contain groups---such as veterans
or social security recipients---who request particular kinds of
constituency service from their representatives. Our research design
limits the influence of this kind of variation in constituent demand by
examining how an individual legislator's rates of contact change
*within* each agency. By looking at the same member representing the
same constituents in the same district to the same agency over time, we
limit the extent to which differing constituent populations could
interfere with our results.

Legislators may also use their official resources to encourage requests
from constituents for help navigating the federal bureaucracy through
workshops, newsletters to constituents, social media posts, and even
stories in local papers. Such constituent outreach may even be a primary
way that constituencies discover that their elected officials can help
with problems they may have with the bureaucracy. If legislators use
increased staff budgets or organizational capacities to solicit
constituent requests, constituent demands may increase as legislator
power increases [@CainFerejohnFiorina1987]. This is entirely consistent
with our theory that increased power and capacity enable legislators to
provide both constituency services and policy work. Our theory and tests
do not require that legislators allocate resources to soliciting
constituency service demand as they gain power, but if they do, the
underlying cause would be shifting legislator capacity, not some
exogenous shift in constituent demand that could confound our analysis.
Thus, changes in constituent demand that result from legislators'
efforts are not a problem for our analysis. Indeed, constituent service
outreach may be a key mechanism for the capacity effects we theorize.

A more challenging form of constituent demand could exist if
constituents redirect their requests toward legislators whom they expect
to be more powerful. Constituents might expect that more powerful
legislators could more effectively provide constituency service and, as
a result, direct their demands toward those legislators. If constituents
strategically redirect their demands for help from representatives who
lost a chair position to representatives who gained a chair position,
this could partially confound our analysis. More realistically, if
constituents redirect requests for help away from new legislators toward
longer-serving legislators, we might observe increases in demand
targeted at more experienced legislators of a delegation whenever a less
experienced legislator replaces another more experienced member of their
state's delegation. To address these sorts of concerns, in @sec-demand,
we conduct a series of robustness checks to rule out alternative
constituency demand-driven explanations. We find no evidence of requests
spilling over to more experienced and powerful members within a state
delegation.

# Data: A Census of Legislator Requests to Federal Agencies {#sec-data}

To assess how experience and power affect constituency service, we filed
`{r} readLines(here::here("docs", "tables", "foia_requests"))` Freedom
Of Information Act (FOIA) requests with all federal departments,
agencies, and sub-agencies for all records of incoming communication
from members of Congress between January 1, 2007, and the date of our
request.[^2] Between February 2017 and February 2024, we received data
on `{r} readLines(here::here("docs", "tables", "n"))` instances of
members of Congress contacting
`{r} readLines(here::here("docs", "tables", "n_agencies"))` federal
agencies. These contacts include letters from an individual legislators,
committee chairs in their capacity as committee chairs, and groups of
legislators. We focus on requests made from 2007 to 2020, resulting in a
data set of `{r} readLines(here::here("docs", "tables", "n2007-2020"))`
contacts.[^3]

[^2]: In addition to our initial requests, collecting these data
    included over a thousand follow-up and clarification emails, dozens
    of hours on the phone with FOIA officers, and nearly 100 appeals of
    incomplete records or inappropriate denials, including multiple
    cases where we pursued and won orders from federal judges requiring
    compliance with our request. Our efforts yielded records from every
    department except the State Department, which has an infamous
    backlog and been processing our request for over seven years. Our
    data also include most independent agencies, commissions, boards,
    executive offices (e.g., the White House Council on Environmental
    Quality and U.S. Trade Representative), and pseudo-governmental
    institutions like Amtrak and the U.S. Export-Import Bank. By
    rigorously pursuing a census of records, we limit any response bias
    that may exist in more easily-obtained samples.

[^3]: Some agencies did not provide records for the full span of years.
    Our models include legislator-by-agency fixed effects to account for
    any left censoring, ensuring that our comparisons leverage variation
    within each agency, limiting the opportunity for censoring to affect
    our results. Because FOIA requests often take several years, data
    for years after 2020 are still incomplete.

## Data processing and coding

Upon receiving records of congressional requests, we extracted names
matching variations of legislators' names. We then merged in data about
members' districts, institutional positions, and careers, including
ideology scores [@dwnominate2018], committee membership
[@StewartWoon2017], and committee oversight [@LewisSelin2012]. The
Appendix provides procedures and replication code for converting the raw
records from federal agencies into the data set required for our
analysis.

For `{r} readLines(here::here("docs", "tables", "n2007-2020coded"))`
requests, we use the text or summaries of letters to classify
legislators' reasons for contacting federal agencies. Our coding process
began with the authors coding a representative sample of records using
our codebook (see Online Appendix). We then trained Research Assistants
to continue the coding. The first several thousand letters were
double-coded. For example, of over 10,000 letters for the Environmental
Protection Agency, the first 2,500 were double-coded. Our overall
inter-coder agreement was 0.78, which rose to 0.9 when we subsetted our
analysis to coding decisions where the coders had a great deal of
certainty.

## Who Contacts the Bureaucracy and Why? {#sec-descriptive}

Before testing theories of how legislators' efforts to provide
constituency service change as they acquire experience and power, we
first use our extensive new data set to answer outstanding descriptive
questions about representation in U.S. politics. These descriptive
findings regarding the level, variation, and reasons for legislator
requests to federal agencies are only possible with our census of
legislator requests. Overall, we find massive variation across
legislators. We also find surprising consistency in the purpose of the
communication; when legislators contact federal agencies, it is almost
always to provide constituency service; only a small fraction focused on
policy work. Further, we find that legislators are responsive to their
constituency's demographic characteristics, but there is still
significant variation in levels of service from similar districts.

### Legislator's Contact with Federal Agencies Focus on Constituency Service

Overall, when legislators contact federal agencies, they are helping
constituents navigate the federal bureaucracy. @fig-type2 shows the
proportion of contacts for each of the five types of legislator requests
in our hand-coded sample described above. The center bar shows that 71%
of all legislator requests to federal agencies are on behalf of
individual constituents. Constituent service requests on behalf of
individual corporations are a smaller percentage, 6%. 7% of requests are
on behalf of nonprofits and local governments. General policy work and
policy work on behalf of specific industries account for just 16% of all
requests made to federal agencies.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Legislator Requests to Federal Agencies by Type, 2007-2020"
#| label: fig-type2
#| out-width: 100%

knitr::include_graphics("docs/figs/data_by_type-tall-1.png")
```

To assess whether legislators shift their priorities as they gain
experience and power, we further group requests into a broader
"constituency service" category (including service for individuals,
corporations, and nonprofits) and "policy work" category (including both
general and industry-focused policy work) for our tests in
@sec-prestige. We find that 76% of requests from committee chairs are
constituency service (compared to 85% for non-chairs). Descriptively,
most legislator requests are constituency service. However, legislators
in more powerful positions have a higher ratio of policy work to
constituency service.[^4]

[^4]: To measure committee prestige, we use a revealed preference
    approach--what do members think is most valuable--using party
    rules/norms that limit members to serving on only one of a small
    number of desirable committees. For House members, the "exclusive"
    committees are: Appropriations, Energy & Commerce, Financial
    Services, Rules, and Ways & Means [@CRS2022]. For Senators, the
    exclusive (also called "Super A") Committees are: Appropriations,
    Armed Services, Finance, and Foreign Relations [@CRS2024].

### Levels of Contact with Federal Agencies are Highly Unequal

Legislators vary significantly in how often they contact federal
agencies. Gini coefficients for the number of contacts per year for the
House and Senate are similar to those for income inequality in Mexico
and the United States, respectively. @fig-contact1 shows the average
number of contact rates per year for House members (left-hand panel) and
senators (right-hand panel). Senator James Webb (D-VA) averaged 533
contacts per year. On average, senators in our data contacted agencies
117 times per year.

#| fig-cap: "Variation in Average Legislator Requests by Percentile"
#| label: fig-contact1
#| out-width: 100%

knitr::include_graphics("docs/figs/percentiles-1.png")
```

We see a similar level of variation in the House, but with lower overall
levels of contact with federal agencies, reflecting lower resources and
fewer constituents than senators. Frank Wolf (R-VA) averaged 377
contacts per year. Like the Senate, other members of the House wrote at
much lower rates. For example, in her first year in Congress, Michele
Bachmann wrote only six letters in our data but would average 31 letters
per year by the end of her time in Congress. Overall, House members
averaged 52 contacts with federal agencies per year. But like the
Senate, we find massive variation in the levels of contact across House
members.

@fig-peryear shows the number of requests per legislator over time,
highlighting three Senators at the upper, middle, and lower parts of the
distribution.

# The Effect of Experience and Institutional Power {#sec-results}

Using this dataset of requests to federal agencies, we estimate the
effect of institutional power on legislator behavior. First, we test
theories rooted in legislator capacity by modeling the effects of
institutional power on a legislator's overall *level* of constituency
service. Next, we test theories rooted in legislators' priorities by
modeling the effects of institutional power on a legislator's *ratio* of
policy work to constituency service.

## The Effects of Experience and Institutional Power on Levels of Constituency Service {#sec-prestige}

Our primary models are difference-in-differences regressions, similar to
the specifications in [@BerryFowler2016]. Our most stringent
specifications examine changes within legislator-agency pairs
(@eq-diff1).[^5]

[^5]: We drop five member-congress level observations for congresses
    where members switched political parties.

$$\begin{aligned}
Y_{ijt} & = & \boldsymbol{\beta}^{'} \textbf{Committee Position}_{it}  + \sum_{s = 1}^{6} \eta_{s} \text{I}\left(\text{tenure}_{it} = s\right) + \gamma_{ij} + \delta_{jt} + m_{it} + p_{it} + \epsilon_{ijt} 
\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-diff1}

Our analysis in this section is at the legislator-agency-year level.
$Y_{ijt}$ is the number of requests legislator $i$ makes to agency $j$
in year $t$. $\gamma_{ij}$ is a fixed effect for the legislator-agency
pair. This fixed effect controls for legislators' characteristics, such
as legislators who are more skillful at filling constituency service
requests than others. Critically for our research design, this fixed
effect also **accounts for time-invariant constituent demand**, ensuring
that differences in constituent requests across legislators do not drive
our results. It also accounts for state and district characteristics,
including population, demographics, and local industries that might be
particularly likely to request help from specific agencies. This
difference-in-difference design ensures that coefficients
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$ capture variation related to changes in
institutional power, not other factors that may vary across districts,
legislators, or agencies. The model also accounts for the different
periods for which data were available from each agency. $\delta_{jt}$ is
an agency-year fixed effect. This takes into account agency-specific
shocks that may affect legislator requests.

Assuming that legislators' trends in the number of requests to a given
agency follow parallel paths over time, $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ represents
the average effect of changing institutional position on a legislator's
provision of constituency service. We focus on three measures of a
legislator's position: (1) whether they are a committee chair, (2)
whether they are a ranking member of a committee, and (3) whether they
are members of a prestige committee. Each position represents a
different way legislators can acquire more power. As a legislator
becomes a committee chair or ranking member, they have increased
responsibilities when drafting and revising legislation. They also have
increased access to committee resources to accomplish policy goals,
particularly the power to direct committee staff. Similarly, legislators
who join more prestigious committees gain opportunities to shepherd
policy through the legislative process.

As [@BerryFowler2016] note, changes in legislators' committee
assignments are often due to circumstances outside of the legislator's
control, such as changing majority status, retirements on a committee,
or exclusion due to losses from a previous election
[@GrimmerPowell2013]. To violate the parallel trends assumption,
legislators must differentially alter their provision of constituency
service in anticipation of joining particular committees. To help avoid
this violation, we include a series of controls that capture
time-varying characteristics of a legislator that might confound our
inference about the effect of committee prestige. Because legislators
may make more requests to a president of the same party
[@BerryBurdenHowell09], it is a particular concern that legislators
obtain new committee assignments when their party moves into or out of
the majority or at the same time as the president's party changes. To
address these concerns, we include indicators for whether the
legislator's party is the majority in year $t$, ($m_{it}$) and if the
legislator is from the same party as the president in year $t$
($p_{it}$). Throughout, we cluster standard errors at the legislator
level.

We also include indicators for legislators' first six years in Congress,
$\sum_{s = 1}^{6} \eta_{s} \text{tenure}_{it}$ as controls. This
specification, however, is not the best specification to assess how
electing a less experienced representative affects the amount of
constituency service a district receives. In @sec-tenure_dist, we test
the effect of legislator experience by estimating how electing a new
representative affects the number of constituency service requests made
on behalf of a district with a different difference-in-differences
specification at the district level.

### The Effect of Institutional Power on Levels of Constituency Service {#sec-prestigeresults}

@tbl-models-total shows estimates from @eq-diff1 of the effect of
institutional power on levels of constituency service. All coefficients
represent the average additional requests per year *per agency*; per
legislator per year effects are simply these coefficients times
`{r} readLines(here::here("docs", "tables", "n_agencies"))` (the number
of agencies).

  # bold header 
    tinytable::style_tt(i = 1, bold = T, line = "b") 
```

Model 1 (the first column of @tbl-models-total shows a cross-sectional
comparison across legislators. Legislators with more institutional power
have higher rates of constituency service. Committee chairs, ranking
members, and members of prestige committees provide substantially more
constituency service than other legislators. However, these
cross-sectional differences may be the result of other legislator
characteristics. If party leaders assign legislators who are better at
their jobs or exert more effort to more prestigious committee positions,
then the estimates from Model 1 confound legislators' overall ability
with their institutional position.

To address potential confounding, Model 2 (Column 2 of @tbl-models-total
shows the difference-in-differences specification in @eq-diff1. Across
all measures of institutional power, we find that acquiring power
increases the number of requests that a given legislator makes. Becoming
a committee chair causes an increase of 0.29 requests *per agency*
(95-percent confidence interval \[0.12, 0.47\]). Across all
`{r} readLines(here::here("docs", "tables", "n_agencies"))` agencies,
this represents an increase of approximately 27 additional requests per
year, 21.3% of the average requests per year in our data.

```{r}

#| label: fig-m-total-predicted
#| out-width: 70%

knitr::include_graphics("docs/figs/m-total-predicted-3.png")
```

@fig-m-total-predicted shows the predicted total number of letters per
year by whether a legislator is a member of the president's party and
whether they are a chair (comparing predictions for counterfactuals
where the same legislator did and did not receive a chair position in
their sixth year).[^6] There is a significant increase when a legislator
becomes a committee chair. There is no significant difference when a
member has a co-partisan president.

[^6]: Predictions are based on a legislator-agency pair where (1) the
    legislators' average annual contacts equaled the overall average,
    (2) the legislators' number of contacts with the agency equal the
    average received by that agency, (3) and the agency received an
    average number of letters.

The findings in @tbl-models-total are robust to alternative
specifications and measures of the dependent variable. For example, we
might be concerned that exceptionally productive legislators drive the
results. The fourth column shows we obtain the same findings if we use
$\log (Y_{ijt} + 1)$ in our difference-in-differences specification.
Further, our results are not due to differential attrition. The third
column shows that we obtain nearly identical results if we restrict our
analysis to legislators who serve beyond three years.

This section has shown that acquiring institutional power causes
legislators to increase constituency service levels. This increase
occurs across all three measures of committee position that we examine
but is most robust for committee chairs.

### The Effect of Electing a New Representative on the Level of Constituency Service {#sec-tenure_dist}

We now turn to a related question: how does the level of constituency
service to a district change after the election of a new representative?
Rather than examining changes in the number of requests by making
within-legislator comparisons, we now make within-district comparisons
to assess how electing a new legislator affects the total number of
requests a district's representative makes. In other words,
within-district comparisons enable us to assess the costs or benefits of
electing a new representative compared to an incumbent.

To illustrate our findings regarding the effect of legislator experience
on contact with the federal bureaucracy, @fig-wi shows the change in
contacts from legislators representing Wisconsin's 7th district in the
House (top) and the Senate (bottom). Consistent with the pattern we
observe in cross-sectional and difference-in-difference designs
described below, newly-elected Representative Sean Duffy initially
provided less constituency service than twenty-term Representative Dave
Obey but was on par with Obey's average number of contacts by year
three. Indeed, the only year in our data with fewer contacts from the
representative of Wisconsin's 7th district than the average member of
the House (the dotted line in the top panel of @fig-wi) was
Representative Duffy's first year in Congress. @fig-wi shows similar
dips in the level of constituency service in the transition from Senator
Feingold to Senator Johnson and from Senator Kohl to Senator Baldwin.
The only years in which Wisconsin's senators contacted the federal
bureaucracy fewer times than the Senate average (the dotted line in the
bottom panel of @fig-wi were Baldwin's first year and Johnson's first
five years in the Senate.

```{r}

#| label: fig-wi
#| out-width: 80%

knitr::include_graphics("figs/districts/(WI-07).png")
knitr::include_graphics("figs/districts/(WI).png")

```

To make this type of district-level comparison systematically, we change
the level of our analysis from the legislator to the district and focus
now on the number of contacts made from the representative of a
particular state or district $i$ in a year $t$, $Y_{it}$. We again use a
difference-in-differences approach to account for district-specific
characteristics and over-time changes in how legislators provide
constituency service. Specifically, we estimate regressions of the form:

$$\begin{aligned}
Y_{it} & = & \beta_{1}\text{New Member}_{it} + \sum_{s = 2}^{6} \beta_{s} \text{tenure}_{s[it]} + \gamma_{i} + \delta_{t} + \epsilon_{it}  
\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-district1}

$\gamma_{i}$ is a district-specific fixed effect that accounts for each
district's particular demographic characteristics, along with the levels
of demand from district residents. $\delta_{t}$ is a year fixed effect
that controls for common shocks. Our key result of interest,
$\beta_{1}$, is the effect of a district electing a new representative.
To understand how the effect of a new representative changes over time,
we estimate district-level differences for a legislator's second
($\beta_{2}$) through sixth-year ($\beta_{6})$.[^7]

[^7]: It is worth noting that this treatment is fundamentally different
    for a district than within-legislator variation. In each election,
    each district allows its incumbent to acquire another term or
    replaces her. This differs from within-legislator comparisons
    because legislators can only acquire more tenure or leave the
    chamber. A within-legislator analysis estimates the service provided
    by incumbents with more or less experience; it cannot estimate the
    impact of the choice of an incumbent or a new representative
    incumbent.

    tinytable::style_tt(i = 1, bold = T, line = "b")
```

The first column of @tbl-models-district provides cross-sectional
differences across districts represented by a new member and legislators
in their first six years in office @eq-district1 minus the district
fixed effect, $\gamma_{i}$). Districts represented by new legislators
receive substantially lower levels of constituency service. On average,
districts with a new representative have 35.2 fewer constituency service
requests made on their behalf. The magnitude of this difference shrinks
for districts represented by legislators in their second year (23.75
fewer constituency service requests). It then reaches a relatively
stable number for districts represented by legislators in their third
through sixth years.

To account for differences in district size, demographics, and demand
for constituency service, Column 2 of @tbl-models-district provides the
estimated effects from the difference-in-differences specification from
@eq-district1. In this specification, we see a large causal effect of a
new member taking over: electing a new member causes a district's
constituency service to decrease by about 40%, or 25.29 letters per year
(95-percent confidence interval \[-16.27, -34.3\]).

The effect of electing a new representative, however, dissipates
quickly. Districts represented by a legislator in their second year of
service receive significantly fewer contacts with federal agencies, but
not as drastic as the difference observed in the first year. After the
second year, the differences are smaller. This phenomenon--new
legislators providing substantially fewer requests--persists when
examining the House (Column 3) and the Senate (Column 4) separately. In
short, new legislators make fewer contacts for their constituents than
established legislators.

the predicted total number of letters per district per year by whether a
district is represented by a new legislator (compared to counterfactuals
where the same legislator has been serving for seven or more years).[^8]

[^8]: Predictions are based on a district-year pair where (1) the
    district's average annual contacts equaled the overall average, (2)
    the district's number of contacts with the agency equal the average
    received by that agency, (3) and the agency received an average
    number of letters.

#### The Costs of Newly Elected Members

Taken together, our results demonstrate that new legislators provide
much less constituency service. Legislators in their first year provide
much less constituency service than they do in their second year and
reach a stable level of service in their third year. Further, when
districts elect a new representative or senator, they experience a sharp
decrease in constituency service requests made on their behalf. Rather
than experienced legislators forgetting about their districts, our
evidence suggests that newly elected legislators experience substantial
start-up costs and struggle to provide the levels of service that
experienced legislators deliver to their constituents.

## The Effect of Experience and Institutional Power on Legislators' Priorities {#sec-priority}

To assess legislators' ratio of policy work to constituency service, we
use the hand-coded data described in @sec-data. The dependent variable
in @tbl-models-ratio is the number of policy requests divided by the
number of constituency service requests per legislator per year. These
models test whether legislators' priorities shift among goals as they
gain experience and power.

                          "This table shows how the proportion of contacts focused on constituency service changes as legislators acquire more experience and power in Congress. Column 1 shows average differences across committee assignments and years in Congress. Column 2 presents difference-in-differences estimates.")) |> 
    tinytable::style_tt(i = 1, bold = T, line = "b")
```

@tbl-models-ratio shows that legislators increase the ratio of policy
work to constituency service as they obtain more prestigious committee
assignments. The first column of @tbl-models-ratio shows how the
proportion of policy work to constituency service differs *across*
legislators for legislators who acquire committee positions.

While the ratio of policy work to constituency service is conditional on
the levels of each, the inference we make about the ratio does not
depend on these levels; we are not using the ratio to infer the level
(e.g., that a lower share of constituency service means a lower level).
Instead, our theory regarding prioritization is about the ratio,
regardless of the level. Levels may interact with the ratio, but not in
ways that do not mean the same thing for our theory, i.e., legislators
prioritize one thing over the other.

Column 2 of @tbl-models-ratio provides the estimated effects from the
difference-in-differences specification. We estimate that becoming a
committee chair causes the ratio of constituency service to policy work
to decrease by 0.08 (95-percent confidence interval \[-0.05 , -0.12 \]).
Becoming a ranking member of a committee causes a decrease of 0.04 in
the ratio.

```

@fig-m-ratio-predicted shows the predicted ratio of constituency service
to policy work by committee chair status and whether that member has a
co-partisan president or not (comparing predictions for counterfactuals
where the same legislator did and did not receive a chairship in their
sixth year). We estimate chair effects using our most senior category of
"7 or more years" as a plausible time at which a chair position would be
acquired. There is a significant difference between the same legislator
as a committee chair and a counterfactual where they are not. Notably,
whether a member has a co-partisan president does not cause a
significant difference.

# The Effects of Demand for Constituency Service {#sec-demand}

This section shows that demand for constituency service affects the
level of constituency service that members provide. However, demand-side
shifts do not appear to explain the specific within-legislator or
within-district variation we observe with changing committee assignments
and increased tenure. We show that this demand does not shift within or
across legislators in ways we would expect to see if shifting
constituent demand explained the within-legislator and within-district
variation in constituency service discussed in @sec-prestigeresults.

## District Characteristics Affect the Provision of Constituency Service

The characteristics of their districts help inform which agencies
legislators contact. We find that population size correlates with the
overall number of requests and that constituency characteristics---the
proportion of veterans and the proportion over 65---correlate with the
distribution of requests across agencies. These correlations provide
face validity for our measures of representation, but they also suggest
that cross-sectional comparisons may conflate legislator choices with
district characteristics. Given this potential conflation, our models
below include fixed effects for each legislator-agency pair, leveraging
within-district and within-agency variation.

We expect senators who represent larger states to make more requests.
Senators from larger states have a larger number of constituents to
serve, and they receive a larger budget to handle that increase in
requests. @fig-stateSize shows that this is the case: senators from
larger states provide more constituency service on average. Senators
from larger states, like John Cornyn (R-TX), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), and
Pat Toomey (R-PA), average more requests per year than legislators from
smaller states. While the number of legislator requests is associated
with population size, @fig-stateSize also shows significant variation in
the level of service senators provide, even among states of similar
sizes.

## Do Voters Demand More of More Powerful Legislators?

Can variation in demand for constituency service explain why more
experience and prestigious committee positions provide more constituency
service?

We limited the influence in demand when assessing how power and
experience affect the levels of constituency service above. For example,
our empirical strategies in @sec-prestige and @sec-priority account for
static demand based on the characteristics of the district. Because our
analyses include either legislator-agency or district fixed effects, we
compare how the levels of constituency service change holding constant
demand related to fixed district characteristics. Furthermore, demand
driven by shifts in legislator behavior is a plausible part of the
increased constituency service we attribute to increased capacity and
resources.

Yet, we might expect that a legislator's experience or power could
affect constituency demand, even without legislators using their
increased capacity and resources to generate demand. For example,
constituents could direct more of their demands to legislators who are
more powerful or who have served longer because they don't know or trust
new representatives (holding constant legislators' levels of soliciting
constituency service requests). As a robustness check, this section
investigates whether that additional constituent demand could plausibly
explain our results. We find no evidence that the higher levels of
constituency service of expierenced members are driven by higher
constituent demand.

If constituents shift demand to more experienced legislators, and such a
shift could explain levels of constituency service, then we should
observe such shifts when a new member is elected. Suppose constituents
shift demand based on legislator experience (as required for constituent
demand to explain our results). In that case, they should redirect their
demands away from newly elected legislators toward other
representatives. The most plausable target for these constituent demands
would be one of the senators representing the constituent's state. While
less plausable, if a new senator replaces a more senior senator, demand
could also shift to more senior members of the house.

To assess whether constituents redirect demand toward other more
experienced legislators when new members replace their more experienced
incumbent representative, we examine how experienced legislators' levels
of constituency service change in response to having new representatives
in their state. As House members generally do not provide constituency
service to people outside their district, for House members we measure
the impact of a new Senator in their state delegation. For Senators we
measure new members in the state in two ways: either the proportion of a
state delegation that is new or an indicator of whether there is a new
legislator (House or Senate) in the delegation. As in
@sec-prestigeresults, we measure the number of requests a district's
representative makes in a particular year. Using this dependent
variable, we estimate a series of difference-in-differences regressions
where the treatment is new members in the state @tbl-models-spillover.
We include district and year fixed effects. We restrict the regression
to incumbent legislators only because we are interested in assessing
whether constituents with new legislators direct their constituency
service requests to these incumbents.

The first column of @tbl-models-spillover estimates the effect of an
experienced Senator being replaced by a new Senator for all other
incumbent legislators, with no significant effect on the level of
constituency service that other legislators in the state provide.
Columns 2 and 3 of @tbl-models-spillover show (insignificant) negative
effect when focusing on senators only. This consistent null finding
regarding the impact of new legislators in a state delegation provides
reassurance that there is no evidence of constituents redirecting demand
toward other, more experienced legislators in response to having new
representatives in their state delegation.

# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

Most legislator contacts with federal agencies focus on constituency
service. While there is massive inequality in the quantity of service
provided by different members, we show that this is not the result of
long-serving members devoting less attention to their district over
time, as the "Potomac Fever" hypothesis suggests. We find evidence that
legislators prioritize policy work as they acquire positions of
institutional power. However, simultaneous increases in capacity that
come with positions of institutional power more than offset shifting
priorities. Critically, the magnitude of the effect of increased
capacity is large enough that the district constituency receives no less
particularistic service from long-serving and powerful legislators.

## Implications for Theory

Our finding that shifts in capacity and priorities simultaneously affect
contacts with agencies implies that scholars of legislator behavior
should focus both on the levels of effort legislators provide and how
they divide that effort. Legislator requests to the bureaucracy are one
of many types of behavior that are likely affected by simultaneous
changes in capacity and priority. In addition to correspondence with
federal agencies, the volume of legislative work, oversight reports, or
hearings produced by a legislator's office depends both on their
capacity to do that work and the relative priority of each task.

Further, our findings suggest that the mechanisms we
identify---organizational efficiency, office resources, and likelihood
of success---help explain legislator behavior. The dramatic decrease in
requests when new legislators take office is consistent with the
organizational efficiency mechanism. Becoming a committee chair
increases the resources available to a legislator and their volume of
contact with federal agencies. Both results are consistent with
legislators making more requests to federal agencies when they are
likely to perceive greater rewards.

The fact that elected officials continue to dedicate substantial
resources to constituency service well into their careers and after they
have achieved high-status institutional positions is evidence that
constituency services is a core function of congressional offices. This
calls for renewed attention to the motivations for and effects of
constituency service in modern U.S. democracy. As we collected and coded
these data, we spoke to numerous staffers and agency officials. A
recurring theme in the data and stories we heard was the interaction
between constituency service casework and other activities, including
oversight investigations and legislation. Conversely, new legislation
often resulted in new forms of constituency service as legislators
helped their constituents attain newly legislated benefits, deal with
new paperwork requirements, or avoid new regulatory requirements. While
constituency service may have underlying electoral motivations, as
formal models suggest, it is also a prominent yet understudied form of
legislator behavior in its own right.

Our finding that experience and institutional power allow legislators to
do more policy work while maintaining levels of constituent service
complements recent scholarship on representation. The same legislators
who @Grose2011, @Dinesen2021, @LowandeRitchieLauterbach2018, and others
find doing more casework for minority groups also likely to do more
policy work on behalf of those groups (in line with @Mendez2018) and
higher rates of advocacy for nonprofits that serve those groups. While
legislators must prioritize limited time [@Kaslovsky2022], institutional
power adds to the capacity of a legislative office as an institution to
pursue both policy work and constituency service. Because institutional
power comes with resources, representation matters not just in Congress
but also in powerful positions like committee chairs.

## Implications for Policy

The large effects of legislator capacity that we find add to a recent
wave of scholarship on the impact of congressional staffing. @LaPira2020
document many effects that decreasing staffing levels may have on the
functioning of Congress. Because increased staff for committee chairs is
a likely mechanism for the capacity effects we find, our results offer a
key outcome measure and effect sizes that may correspond to additional
staff. While committee chairs simultaneously obtain other forms of power
like agenda control, to the extent that our results reflect the capacity
boost of committee staff, our evidence suggests that congressional staff
likely have measurable and potentially large effects on the volume of
work legislators can do.

Advocates for term limits often argue that elected officials lose touch
with their district. In contrast, we show that more experienced
legislators provide as much or more service to their district, even as
they do more policy work. Moreover, our results show that new
legislators have less capacity to make requests to federal agencies.
Removing experienced legislators would likely decrease levels of
constituency service.

## Future Research

Future research should further examine the mechanisms by which
increasing experience and capacity shape legislator behavior. This could
include explicit measures of office organization and efficiency and more
nuanced measures of institutional power. This could also include
measuring agency responsiveness to legislator requests. Likewise, future
research could examine mechanisms related to shifting priorities.
Finally, future work could include legislators' substantive areas of
expertise. Does expertise increase a legislator's capacity to act in
certain areas (e.g., certain agencies), leading to more capacity for
constituency service? Does increased institutional power lead
legislators to develop expertise, for example, in certain committee work
or specialized policy work that builds their capacity to influence
certain agencies?

The massive new dataset we introduce here will help scholars answer
these questions. With data from nearly all parts of the vast U.S.
federal bureaucracy, future work can advance the study of descriptive
representation, expanding on work by @LowandeRitchieLauterbach2018, who
find that women, minority, and veteran members do more casework on
behalf of groups that share their identity. The new data we collect will
allow similar tests of representation for other demographic groups,
including seniors, farmers, and low-income populations, to name just a
few. Likewise, more data will allow new tests of prior work showing that
members use lobbying the bureaucracy to advance policy goals when they
conflict with their party's agenda [@Ritchie2017]. Our systematic data
allow tests of variation across policy domains and government functions.

Critically, our systematic approach to data collection allows more
general tests of legislator behavior. Any sample focusing on a few
policy domains or agencies will over-represent legislators sitting on
certain oversight committees and representing certain constituencies.
Our near-census of legislator contacts minimizes such confounders and
will allow researchers to test more general theories of legislator
behavior, as we have done here.

# Conclusion {#sec-conclude}

As legislators gain experience and power, they both gain the capacity to
make more requests to agencies while simultaneously shifting priorities
to policy work. Crucially, the increase in capacity is large enough
relative to the shift in attention toward policy work that legislators
maintain or even increase levels of constituency service as they gain
institutional power. Consistent with our theory that experience
increases capacity, we also show that legislators make fewer service
requests at the start of their careers and that new legislators make
substantially fewer service requests than their more experienced
colleagues.
