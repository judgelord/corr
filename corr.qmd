  When elected officials gain power, do they use it to provide more constituent service or affect policy? The answer informs debates over how legislator capacity, term limits, and institutional positions affect legislator behavior.  We distinguish two countervailing effects of increased institutional power: shifting priorities and increased capacity.  To assess how institutional power shapes behavior, we assemble a massive new database of 611,239 legislator requests to a near census of federal departments, agencies, and sub-agencies between 2007 and 2020. We find that legislators prioritize policy work as they gain institutional power (e.g., become a committee chair) but simultaneously maintain their levels of constituency service. Moreover, when a new legislator replaces an experienced legislator, the district receives less constituency service *and* less policy work. Rather than long-serving and powerful elected officials diverting attention from constituents, their increased capacity enables them to maintain levels of constituency service, even as they prioritize policy work.

# Introduction

One of the oldest traditions of representation in American politics is
constituency service--how members of Congress help channel and
articulate the demands of individuals, groups, and localities to the
federal government [@Fenno1978]. Advocating on behalf of their
constituents to federal agencies is a crucial part of a modern
legislator's job and may explain the incumbency
advantage [@King1991]. Yet, despite the centrality of constituency
service in theories of congressional representation, constituency
service remains one of the least understood congressional activities.

This paper examines how increasing power affects the provision of
constituency service. On the one hand, institutional power may enable
legislators to provide more constituency service. Formal models of
accountability imply that if constituency service enables elected
officials to demonstrate competence to their constituents, then
increased institutional power and capacity will result in more
constituency service effort to secure reelection
[@AshworthBuenodeMesquita2006]. Experienced incumbents may also have an advantage over challengers if newly elected officials incur start-up costs that reduce their capacity to provide constituency service.

On the other hand, we might expect that as legislators spend more time
in Washington, they become more focused on 
policy work and less attentive to their district and constituents. This
dynamic is central to theories of representation focusing on
trade-offs legislators face in their careers. Many assume that the
effect of shifting priorities is large enough to cause long-serving
legislators to catch "Potomac fever" and devote less attention to
constituents back in their district [@Fenno1978]. Such reasoning is the
primary justification for term limits. Related arguments are common in
the popular press [@Edwards2005] and evoked in rallying cries to "drain
the swamp" of legislators focused on Washington politics
[@Rosenblatt2016].

We test these competing expectations with a new dataset of
constituency service and policy work: a near census of legislator
contacts with federal agencies from 2007 to 2020. Recent work using data
on congressional correspondence has yielded important findings regarding distributive politics [@MillsKalafHuges2015],
the policy strategies of cross-pressured legislators [@Ritchie2017],
, and the role of ideology in congressional oversight [@Lowande2018JOP].
Except for work by @LowandeRitchieLauterbach2018 on descriptive representation and @Powell2023FERC on money in politics, this
emerging scholarship has focused on policy work (not constituency
service). Adding to this work, our theory and research design focus on
simultaneous shifts in constituency service and policy work.

Given the difficulty in collecting these data, previous work has been
restricted to small subsets of agencies and, thus, a small subset of
policy domains. Our larger dataset enables us to comprehensively test
how the behavior of legislators shifts as they gain institutional power
and ensures that our conclusions are not limited to subsets of the
executive branch.

To assess absolute and relative shifts in legislator contacts to agencies, we hand-code the content of `r n2007_2020coded` (of our total  `r n2007_2020`) requests as policy work or constituency service. Doing so also yields many illuminating descriptives about modern legislator behavior. For example, over 80% of contacts are on behalf of constituents, and less than 20% focus on policy work.

We find evidence for both of the countervailing effects of experience and institutional
power that we theorize, supporting both theories of legislator behavior that focus on *legislator capacity*
and those that focus on *shifting priorities*. As expected by theories focusing on both capacity and priorities, more experienced and powerful legislators do significantly more policy work. Critically, however, the magnitude of the effect of increasing capacity on constituency service
offsets the effect of shifting priorities toward policy work. Even as legislators'
attention shifts towards policy as they gain power in Washington, they maintain or increase levels of constituency service. Moreover, when voters in a district replace an experienced legislator with a new legislator, they receive less constituency service *and* less policy work on their behalf. Voters do not face a trade-off between powerful and attentive representatives.

These findings are robust; they are not the result of exogenous
variation in constituent demand, differences across districts, or
differences across legislators. Our research designs limit the influence
of any potential variation in constituent demand by leveraging
within-legislator and within-district comparisons. Moreover, through a
series of additional analyses, we find no evidence
that constituents shift demands to more established legislators when a new representative is elected. When House members lose an election, there is no corresponding increase in constituency service requests from the state's Senate delegation.

While this study does not aim to examine the effects of institutional
reforms, our results have implications for debates over congressional
staffing and term limits. Advocates for increasing congressional
staffing have long argued that declining capacity has hamstrung Congress
[@Reynolds2020]. Consistent with these arguments, we show that
legislators with access to more staff resources do significantly more policy work.
Advocates for term limits assert that powerful career politicians become
alienated from their constituents. We show, however, that even as
legislators gain power, they remain focused on providing constituency
service. In contrast to arguments from term limit
supporters, the biggest decrease in constituency service occurs when a
new legislator replaces an experienced legislator. Our findings imply
that the turnover that term limits induce would cause a sharp decrease
in the volume of work from legislative offices.

We proceed as follows. @sec-theory explains divergent predictions about
how institutional position and tenure affect legislators' behavior.
@sec-data explains our data collection process and summary statistics.
@sec-results shows that as legislators gain experience and institutional
power, they maintain or increase their levels of constituency service,
even as they shift their priorities toward policy work. @sec-demand
examines alternative
explanations. @sec-discussion highlights the implications
of these findings for theories of legislative behavior and institutional
reform debates.

# Do Experience and Power Increase or Decrease Constituency Service? {#sec-theory}

How elected officials balance their work on broad policy goals and delivering particularistic service to their constituents and district presents a significant tension for representation. Building on multi-task models of representation [@AshworthBuenodeMesquita2006; @gordon2009advantages], we explain why increasing experience and power may either increase or decrease the levels of constituency service legislators provide depending on the relative magnitudes of the effects of increasing capacity and changing priorities.

## Increasing Capacity: Why Experience and Power Could *Increase* Constituency Service

As elected officials garner more experience in Congress, one prediction
from formal models of accountability is that legislators will provide
more constituency service as their capacity to do so increases. An
influential set of formal theory papers argues that voters are
fundamentally engaged in a screening task: attempting to identify
elected officials who can effectively deliver
representation to the district [@AshworthBuenodeMesquita2006;
@gordon2009advantages]. Under this model of representation, constituency
service helps reelection-minded legislators increase their chances of
reelection if they can exceed constituents' expectations of the level of
service that another candidate would provide. These models predict that
as a legislator's resources and capacity increase, they will increase
their level of constituency service [@AshworthBuenodeMesquita2006
Proposition 1].

Critically, constituents' demands for service do not go away. Even if
constituents value their representative's power over policy, they still
expect their elected officials to be attentive to the district.
Moreover, if constituency service helps with reelection, legislators may
invest in *creating* demands (for example, by advertising constituency
services) that they can then meet.

The low level of congressional capacity in the
modern Congress serves as a major constraint on Congress's ability to
function [@LaPira2020]. Experience in office and institutional power may
increase an individual legislator's capacity in many ways. Because many
of these mechanisms are observationally equivalent, we focus on capacity
in general and three mechanisms by which experience and
institutional power may affect behavior: 1) increased resources, 2)
increased organizational efficiency, and 3) an increased likelihood of
success when making a request.

### Mechanism 1: Increased Resources

As legislators acquire more institutional power, they usually gain more
resources. For example, becoming chair of a Congressional committee
allows legislators to direct committee staff and
a larger budget. Staff provide
legislators with the capacity to accomplish their goals
[@DeGregorio1994; @Hall1996; @HertelFernandez2019; @MontgomeryNyhan2017;
@McCrain2018; @CrossonEtAl2020; @Reynolds2020] and may counteract the
power of lobbyists [@HallDeardorff2006]. Even if committee resources are earmarked for policy work, they can still increase a chair's capacity
for constituency service if they
free up personal office resources for constituency service.

### Mechanism 2: Increased Organizational Efficiency

More organized legislator offices are better able to help constituents
navigate the federal bureaucracy. On average, more experienced legislators
should have better systems that allow them to make more constituency
service requests than new legislators. For example, @Cottle2022 finds that more experienced legislators and senior
staff are more productive.
Newly-elected legislators must hire staff, open district offices, and establish procedures in their office for handling constituency service requests. 
In terms of formal models, office organization increases legislators' capacity [@AshworthBuenodeMesquita2006].


### Mechanism 3: Increased Likelihood of Success

In fulfilling statutory missions, agency officials use broad discretion to prioritize resources as they process visa, permit, and grant applications,
regulating compliance with environmental, health, and
labor laws, and much more. Legislators are in a position to influence
these decisions. Agency staff often assign special
importance to elected officials' requests, tagging congressional correspondence as "VIP." Agency protocols
require faster response deadlines and higher signature levels for
replies to members of Congress. Bureaucrats actively build relationships and reputations that enhance their standing among members of Congress and those who have their ear [@Carpenter2001]. 
If agency staff aim to grow their coalition of political supporters, we expect
them to accommodate congressional requests frequently.

As legislators gain power, bureaucrats may become more responsive.
More powerful legislators can more easily alter an agency's budget or
create additional work through Congressional hearings. As a result,
agencies may prioritize requests from more powerful members of Congress.
For example, @MillsKalafHuges2015 find that the Federal Aviation Administration was
more likely to grant the requests of senior members of Congress.
@Lowande2018JOP finds that agencies systematically
prioritize the requests of majority party legislators.
A related literature finds that seniority and committee
membership affect the distribution of earmarked spending in agency budgets [@Lazarus2010].
Increased marginal returns may incentivize more powerful legislators to
make more requests [@CainFerejohnFiorina1987].[^1] 

[^1]: Because we are studying legislator behavior rather than agency
    behavior, this mechanism only requires that more powerful
    legislators occasionally believe that they are more likely to get a
    response. Regarding agency behavior, there is active scholarly
    debate over whether agencies respond differently to more powerful
    legislators. In contrast to canonical theories set out by
    @Arnold1979, @BerryBurdenHowell09 find no evidence that committee
    membership shaped the distribution of executive-branch spending.
    @RitchieYou2018 find that legislator requests influenced Department
    of Labor decisions, but notably, this influence was not correlated
    with oversight committee membership. Likewise, @MillsKalafHuges2015
    even find that the Federal Aviation Administration was *less* likely
    to grant the requests of members of their authorizing committee,
    which they attribute to the agency punishing committee members for
    recent budget cuts.

Because this third mechanism operates as a multiplier on institutional
power and organizational capacity, it is observationally equivalent to
the first two mechanisms for our analysis. In short, the observable
implications of theories emphasizing the effects of capacity and
resources are that legislators with more experience and more powerful
institutional positions like committee chairs will do more constituency
service work.

## Shifting Priorities: Why Experience and Power Could *Decrease* Constituency Service

Political science literature on Congressional careers offers a different set of expectations for how legislator behavior may change
in response to increased experience and power.
In addition to reelection goals, legislators have policy goals, and different institutional positions allow legislators to advance different goals [@Fenno1973].
As @ButlerKarpowitzPope2012 [p. 475] conclude, "The
service-policy divide is thus an important theoretical lens through
which legislative behavior can be viewed." As legislators gain
experience and power, the marginal impact of the resources they allocate
to policy work increases. Powerful legislators thus have incentives to
shift their attention to policy work. 

As legislators spend more time in Washington, they may also become detached from their district. 
@Fenno1978 documents how some members of Congress catch "Potomac fever."  As
legislators spend more time in office and attain more influential
institutional roles, legislators might focus on policy priorities and
less on the particular demands of their constituents. <!--While newly
elected officials may remain primarily focused on reelection,
longer-serving officials may prioritize other goals.-->

If the shifting priorities hypothesis is right---that legislators shift
attention from their district to policy work---we expect that
legislators provide *relatively less* constituent service compared to
policy work as they gain experience and power. The "Potomac fever" concern is that, as legislators gain experience and power, the shift toward prioritizing policy work is
large enough to swamp any increase in capacity. If this strong ("Potomac fever") version of the shifting priorities hypothesis is true, we should
find that legislators provide *less* constituent service in absolute
terms.

A parallel argument about legislator behavior is the foundation of
arguments for institutional reforms, particularly arguments for term
limits. For example, during a 2019 Senate committee hearing, Senator Ted
Cruz (R-TX) argued in favor of term limits by stating that at our
nation's founding, politicians traveled to Washington to serve in
Congress "for a time but usually returned to their homes and their
affairs," while today, "far too many of our politicians come to
Washington to stay," [@termlimit2019].

Formal models of legislator behavior predict that as legislators prioritize
policy work in Washington, the ratio of constituency service to policy work will decrease. 
All else equal, they will then provide lower
levels of constituency service to their district. In the model in
@AshworthBuenodeMesquita2006, this would occur as legislators place a
lower priority on constituency service. 

If legislators' priorities shift over their careers or as they gain power, more experienced and powerful
legislators will allocate more *staff* to policy work over constituency
service. Likewise, if members shift their *attention* from their
district to their career in Washington (in Congress or after), their
relative level of attention to constituent issues will decrease.

## The Countervailing Effects of Increasing Capacity and Shifting Priorities on Constituency Service

The increased capacity and shifting priorities hypotheses are not
mutually exclusive. Legislators' career shifts may simultaneously
increase their resources and decrease their relative priority on
constituency service. The net effect of these countervailing shifts on levels of constituency service thus depends on the
*relative* magnitude of capacity increase compared to the
magnitude of the shift in priorities. Increased capacity may offset a
*relative* shift away from constituency service as a legislator gains
power. If this occurs, the absolute level of constituency
service may stay the same or even increase as legislators gain experience and
power despite their ratio of constituent service to policy work
decreasing. Alternatively, if the effect of increased capacity is
relatively small or the effect of shifting priorities relatively large,
absolute levels of constituency service may decline as a legislator
gains power.

@tbl-theory and @fig-2x2 show potential changes in the absolute volume
of constituency service and the ratio of constituency service to policy work due to *changes in capacity* and *shifting priorities*. 
The bottom left cell of @tbl-theory shows our expectations if capacity increases but priorities remain unchanged (Subfigure a of @fig-2x2). 
The top right cell of @tbl-theory shows our expectations if priorities change and capacity remains unchanged (Subfigure b of @fig-2x2) or insufficiently changed (any outcome in the lower, lighter-shaded region of @fig-2x2, Subfigure d) to compensate for a given magnitude of priority shift. 
The top-left cell of @tbl-theory shows our expectations if both mechanisms
affect behavior *and* the magnitude of the effect of increased capacity
is large enough to overcome the countervailing effect of shifting
priorities (any outcome in the upper, darker-shaded region of @fig-2x2,
Subfigure d, including the outcome shown in Subfigure c).

```

@fig-2x2 formalizes the potential outcomes implied by our theory to
clarify the conditions under which constituency service will increase or
decrease as an elected official's capacity and priorities change. For
simplicity, @fig-2x2 assumes a baseline capacity of 100 (e.g., 100
requests to federal agencies per year) and a baseline ratio of
constituency service to policy work of 80:20 (80% constituency service).
It visualizes potential outcomes for changes in capacity extending up to
150% of baseline capacity. The level of policy work, $x$,
done by elected official, $i$, depends on their capacity,
$c$, and relative priority for constituency service versus policy work,
$p \in [0, 1]$ (observed as the share of requests that are constituency
service rather than policy work) such that $x_i = c_i (1-p_i)$. An
elected official's level of constituency service, $y_i$, likewise
depends on their overall capacity and priorities such that
$y_i = c_i p_i$. For any given level of capacity, $y_i = c_i-x_i$
specifies a line of possible divisions of capacity between policy work
and constituency service. Increasing capacity pushes this "capacity
frontier" line to the upper right (@fig-2x2, Subfigure a). Where on
this line a legislator falls at any point in time depends on their
relative priority for policy work and constituency service (@fig-2x2,
Subfigure b). If capacity and priorities shift simultaneously,
priorities can shift toward policy while levels of constituency service
are maintained or even increase (@fig-2x2, Subfigure c). The relative
magnitude of these two effects determines whether constituency service
will increase or decrease (@fig-2x2, Subfigure d). When
$c_{i1}p_{i1} > c_{i2}p_{i2}$, constituency service decreases between
time 1 and time 2. When $c_{i1}p_{i1} < c_{i2}p_{i2}$ constituency
service increases. When $c_{i1}p_{i1} = c_{i2}p_{i2}$, there is no
change in constituency service.

## Alternative Explanations for Changes in Constituency Service: Constituent Demand

We aim to understand how gaining power and experience in Washington
affects legislator behavior. But often, legislators
depend on constituents to ask for help navigating the federal
bureaucracy. An alternative explanation for why legislators' levels of
constituency service vary is that they receive differing
numbers of requests from their constituents for reasons unrelated to their capacity or experience. 
While variation in constituent demand is substantively interesting, such an explanation for
constituency service provision does not inform debates about the extent
to which legislators' capacity and priorities change with their time in
office and institutional position.

Of course, constituent demands inform which agencies legislators
contact. For example, some districts contain groups---such as veterans
or social security recipients---who request particular kinds of
constituency service from their representatives. Our research design
limits the influence of this kind of variation in constituent demand. 
By looking at the same member representing the
same constituents in the same district to the same agency over time, we
limit the extent to which differing constituent populations could
interfere with our results.

Legislators may also use their official resources to encourage requests
from constituents for help navigating the federal bureaucracy through
workshops, newsletters to constituents, social media posts, or
stories in local papers. Such constituent outreach may be a primary
way constituencies discover that their elected officials can help. 
If legislators use
increased staff budgets or organizational capacities to solicit
constituent requests, constituent demands may increase as legislator
power increases [@CainFerejohnFiorina1987]. This is entirely consistent
with our theory that increased power and capacity enable legislators to
provide both constituency services and policy work. Our theory and tests
do not require that legislators allocate resources to soliciting
constituency service demand as they gain power, but if they do, the
underlying cause would be shifting legislator capacity, not some
exogenous shift in constituent demand that could confound our analysis.
Thus, changes in constituent demand that result from legislators'
efforts are not a problem for our analysis. Indeed, constituent service
outreach may be a key mechanism for the capacity effects we theorize.

A more challenging form of constituent demand could exist if
constituents redirect their requests toward legislators whom they see as more powerful. Constituents might expect more powerful
legislators to be more helpful and, as
a result, direct their demands toward those legislators. If constituents
strategically redirect their demands from representatives who
lost a chair position to representatives who gained a chair position,
this could partially confound our analysis. More realistically, if
constituents redirect requests for help away from new legislators toward
longer-serving legislators, we might observe increases in demand
targeted at more experienced legislators of a delegation whenever a less
experienced legislator replaces another more experienced member of their
state's delegation. To address such concerns,
we conduct a series of analyses to test alternative
constituency demand-driven explanations in @sec-demand. We find no evidence of requests
spilling over to more experienced and powerful members within a state
delegation.

# Data: A Census of Legislator Requests to Federal Agencies {#sec-data}

To assess how experience and power affect constituency service, we filed
434 Freedom
Of Information Act (FOIA) requests with all federal departments,
agencies, and sub-agencies for all records of incoming communication
from members of Congress between January 1, 2007, and the date of our
request.[^2] Between February 2017 and February 2024, we received records
on `r n2007_2020` instances of members of Congress contacting
`r n_agency` federal agencies from 2007 to 2020.[^3] These contacts include letters from individual legislators,
committee chairs in their capacity as committee chairs, and groups of
legislators. We had sufficient information on `r n2007_2020coded` of these contacts to hand-code for whether they focus on constituency service or policy. Models in @sec-capacity and @sec-district use the full sample. Models in @sec-priority and @sec-joint use the hand-coded sample. 

[^2]: In addition to our initial requests, collecting these data
    included over a thousand follow-up and clarification emails, dozens
    of hours on the phone with FOIA officers, and nearly 100 appeals of
    incomplete records or inappropriate denials, including multiple
    cases where we pursued and won orders from federal judges requiring
    compliance with our request. Our efforts yielded records from every
    department except the State Department, which has an infamous
    backlog and has been processing our requests for over seven years. Our
    data also include most independent agencies, commissions, boards,
    executive offices (e.g., the White House Council on Environmental
    Quality and U.S. Trade Representative), and pseudo-governmental
    institutions like Amtrak and the U.S. Export-Import Bank. By
    rigorously pursuing a census of records, we limit any response bias
    that may exist in more easily obtained samples.

[^3]: Some agencies did not provide records for the full span of years.
    Our models include legislator-agency fixed effects to account for
    any left censoring, ensuring that our comparisons leverage variation
    within each agency. Because FOIA requests often take several years, data
    for years after 2020 are still incomplete.

## Data processing and coding

Upon receiving records of congressional requests, we extracted author names from the text
matching variations of legislators' names using `legislators` R package [@legislators]. We then merged in data about
members' districts, partisanship, institutional positions, and careers [@dwnominate2018], committee membership and leadership positions
[@StewartWoon2017; @unitedstates, and committee oversight [@LewisSelin2012].^[Our
procedures and code for converting the raw
records from federal agencies into the dataset required for our
analysis are available at github.com/judgelord/correspondence.]

We use the text or summaries of letters to classify
legislators' reasons for contacting federal agencies into five types: requests on behalf of (1)
individual constituents, (2) individual corporations, (3) nonprofits and local governments, (4) policy work on behalf of specific industries, or (5) general policy work. Our coding process
began with the authors coding a representative sample of records using
our codebook (see Supplemental Information). We then trained research assistants
to continue the coding. The first several thousand letters were
double-coded. For example, of over 10,000 letters for the Environmental
Protection Agency, the first 2,500 were double-coded. Our overall
inter-coder agreement was 0.78, which rose to 0.9 when we removed coding decisions where coders were uncertain.

## Who Contacts the Bureaucracy and Why? {#sec-descriptive}

Before testing theories of how legislator behavior changes as they acquire experience and power, we use our extensive new data set to answer outstanding descriptive questions about legislator behavior in U.S. politics. These descriptive
findings regarding the level, variation, and reasons for legislator
requests to federal agencies are only possible with our census of
legislator requests. Overall, we find a general focus on constituency service but massive variation across
legislators. <!---Further, we find that legislators are responsive to their
constituency's demographic characteristics, but there is still
significant variation in levels of service from similar districts.---> 

### Legislator Contacts with Federal Agencies Focus on Constituency Service

<!--Overall, when legislators contact federal agencies, they are helping
constituents navigate the federal bureaucracy.--> @fig-type2 shows the
proportion of contacts for each of the five types of legislator requests
in our hand-coded sample described above. The center bar shows that 71%
of all legislator requests to federal agencies are on behalf of
individual constituents. Requests on behalf of individual corporations are a smaller percentage, 6%. 7% of requests are
on behalf of nonprofits and local governments. General policy work and
policy work on behalf of specific industries account for just 16% of all
requests made to federal agencies.

```{r}

#| label: fig-type2
#| out-width: 80%

knitr::include_graphics("docs/figs/data_by_type-tall-1.png")
```

To assess whether legislators shift their priorities as they gain
experience and power, we further group requests into a broader
"constituency service" category (including service for individuals,
corporations, and nonprofits) and "policy work" category (including both
general and industry-focused policy work) for our tests in
@sec-capacity. Descriptively,
most legislator requests are constituency service. However, legislators
in more powerful positions have a lower ratio of 
constituency service to policy work.  We find that 76% of requests from committee chairs are
constituency service (compared to 85% for non-chairs).

### Levels of Contact with Federal Agencies are Highly Unequal

Legislators vary significantly in how often they contact federal
agencies. Since 2016, Gini coefficients for inequality in the number of contacts per year for the
House and Senate range between 0.56 and 0.90, exceeding the Gini coefficient for income inequality in every country the World Bank reported in 2023. To visualize this variation, @fig-contact1 shows the average number of contacts per year for House members (left panel) and
senators (right panel).[^5] On average, senators in our data contacted agencies
148 times per year, while House members averaged 54 per year. We see a similar level of variation in the House but with lower overall levels of contact with federal agencies, reflecting lower resources and fewer constituents than senators.

```


Among the most prolific senators, Senator Byrd (D-WV) averaged 538
contacts per year, Senator Nelson (D-FL) averaged 535, and Senator Webb (D-VA) averaged 533 contacts per year. 

<!--
Rep. Barbara Comstock averaged 349 contacts per year. Comstock replaced Rep. Frank Wolf (R-VA), who averaged 381 contacts per year and inherited many of his staff. 
<!--Comstock had worked in Rep. Frank Wolf's congressional office for five years, described him as a "longtime mentor," and claimed that Wolf first urged her to run for office. He endorsed and campaigned with her. 
--> 
<!--
Nevertheless, Comstock's first year saw the volume of contacts on behalf of Virginia's 10th district dip slightly to 245, the lowest level in our time period. <!--Other members of the House wrote at
much lower rates. For example, in her first year in Congress, Michele
Bachmann wrote only six letters in our data but would average 31 letters
per year by the end of her time in Congress.-->

# The Effect of  Institutional Power and Experience {#sec-results}

Using this dataset of requests to federal agencies, we estimate the
effect of institutional power on legislator behavior. First, @sec-capacity and @sec-district test
theories rooted in legislator *capacity* by modeling the effects of
institutional power and experience on a legislator's total number of requests to federal agencies. 
Next, @sec-priority test theories rooted in legislators' *priorities* by
modeling the effects of institutional power on a legislator's ratio of
constituency service to policy work.
@sec-joint then examines the impact of power and experience on a legislator's *level* of constituency service, showing that increasing capacity allows legislators to maintain levels of constituency service even as they prioritize policy work.

## The Effect of Institutional Power on Legislator *Capacity* {#sec-capacity}


Our analysis in this section is at the legislator-agency-year level.
Our primary models are difference-in-differences regressions, similar to
the specifications in @BerryFowler2016. Our most stringent
specifications test for differences within legislator-agency pairs
(@eq-diff1).[^9]

[^9]: We drop ten member-year level observations where members switched chambers mid-congress.

$$\begin{aligned}
Y_{ijt} & = & \boldsymbol{\beta}^{'} \textbf{Committee Position}_{it}  + \sum_{s = 1}^{6} \eta_{s} \text{I}\left(\text{tenure}_{it} = s\right) + \gamma_{ij} + \delta_{jt} + m_{it} + p_{it} + \epsilon_{ijt} 
\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-diff1}

$Y_{ijt}$ is the number of requests legislator $i$ makes to agency $j$
in year $t$. $\gamma_{ij}$ is a fixed effect for the legislator-agency
pair. This fixed effect controls for **legislators' characteristics**, such
as legislators who are more skillful at filling constituency service
requests than others. Critically for our research design, this fixed
effect also accounts for **time-invariant constituent demand**, ensuring
that differences in constituent requests across legislators do not drive
our results. It also accounts for **state and district characteristics**,
including population, demographics, and local industries that might be
particularly likely to request help from specific agencies. 
$\delta_{jt}$ is an agency-year fixed effect that accounts for agency-specific
shocks that may affect legislator requests and the different
periods for which data were available from each agency.
This difference-in-difference design ensures that coefficients
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$ capture variation related to changes in
institutional power, not other factors that may vary across districts,
legislators, or agencies. 

 

Assuming that legislators' trends in the number of requests to a given
agency follow parallel paths over time, $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ represents
the average effect of changing institutional position on their number of requests *per agency*. 
We focus on three measures of institutional power: (1) whether they are a committee chair, (2)
whether they are the ranking member of a committee, and (3) whether they
are members of a prestige committee. Each position represents a
different way legislators can acquire more power. As a legislator
becomes a committee chair or ranking member, they have increased
responsibilities when drafting and revising legislation. They also have
increased access to committee resources,
including power to direct committee staff. Similarly, legislators
who join more prestigious committees gain opportunities to shepherd
policy through the legislative process.[^4]

[^4]: To measure committee prestige, we take a revealed preference
    approach (what members think is most valuable) using party
    rules that limit members to serving on only one of certain desirable committees. For House members, these "exclusive" committees are Appropriations, Energy & Commerce, Financial Services, Rules, and Ways & Means [@CRS2022]. For Senators, these exclusive ("Super A") Committees are: Appropriations,
    Armed Services, Finance, and Foreign Relations [@CRS2024].


Changes in legislators' committee
assignments are often due to circumstances outside of the legislator's
control, such as changing majority status, retirements on a committee,
or exclusion due to losses from a previous election
[@GrimmerPowell2013, @BerryFowler2016]. To violate the parallel trends assumption,
legislators must differentially alter their rates of contacting federal agencies
in anticipation of joining particular committees. To help avoid
this violation, we include a series of controls that capture
time-varying characteristics of a legislator. Because legislators
may make more requests to a president of the same party
[@BerryBurdenHowell09], it is a particular concern that legislators
obtain new committee assignments when their party moves into or out of
the majority or at the same time as the president's party changes. To address these concerns, we include indicators for whether the
legislator's party is the majority in year $t$, ($m_{it}$) and if the
legislator is from the same party as the president in year $t$
($p_{it}$). We cluster standard errors at the legislator
level ($\epsilon_{ijt}$).

We also include indicators for legislators' first six years in Congress (House or Senate),
$\sum_{s = 1}^{6} \eta_{s} \text{tenure}_{it}$ as controls. This
specification, however, is not the best specification to assess how
electing a less experienced representative affects the number of requests made on behalf of a given district. 
In @sec-district, we test
the effect of legislator experience by estimating how electing a new
representative affects the number of requests made
on behalf of a district with a difference-in-differences
specification at the district level.

@tbl-models-total shows estimates of the effect of
institutional power on the number of requests a legislator makes to federal agencies. All coefficients represent the average additional requests per year *per agency* (per
legislator per year effects are simply these coefficients times
`r n_agency`, the number
of agencies).

modelsummary(models_total,
             center_rows = 23:29,

                          "This table shows how the number of requests changes as legislators acquire more experience and power.

                          All coefficients represent the average additional requests per year per agency per legislator. Legislator per year effects are simply these coefficients times the number of agencies in the data.")) 
```

Model 1 (the first column of @tbl-models-total) shows differences across legislators. Legislators with more institutional power make more requests. Committee chairs, ranking
members, and members of prestige committees all make substantially more requests than other legislators.  Because we estimate the effects of becoming a committee chair and being a member of a prestige committee in the same model, these effects are additive: prestige committee chairs may make more requests than non-prestige committee chairs who make more requests than non-chairs.

However, these cross-sectional differences may be the result of other legislator
characteristics. If party leaders assign legislators who are better at
their jobs to more prestigious committee positions,
then the estimates from Model 1 confound legislators' overall ability
with their institutional position. To address potential confounding, Models 2-4 (Columns 2-4 of @tbl-models-total)
show the difference-in-differences specification in @eq-diff1. 

### More Powerful Legislators Make More Requests to Federal Agencies

Across all measures of institutional power, acquiring power
increases the number of requests a given legislator makes. Becoming
a committee chair causes an increase of `r beta$chair` requests *per agency*
(95-percent confidence interval [`r beta$chair-1.96*se$chair`, `r beta$chair+1.96*se$chair`]. Across all
`r n_agency` agencies,
this represents an increase of approximately `r round(beta$chair*n_agency)` additional requests per
year, **a `r percent(beta$chair*n_agency/84)` increase** over the average requests per year in our data.  

Other measures of institutional power included in these models (ranking member and prestige committee member) are also associated with increased levels of contact with federal agencies, but these effects are only significant at the .05 level in the cross-sectional model (Models 1) and, for ranking member, in the difference in differences design with the logged number of contacts as the dependent variable (Model 4). 

Evidence about the effects of majority party status or having a co-partisan president is less conclusive. Majority party status is negatively associated with contacting agencies only in Models 1 and 4. On average, having a co-partisan president is negatively associated with contacting agencies (Model 1). However, models of within-legislator variation seem to show that gaining a co-partisan president leads to making more requests (only statistically significant with the logged number of contacts as the dependent variable in Model 4).

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Predicted Number of Total Requests to Federal Agencies (Within Legislator Difference in Differences), 2007-2020"
#| label: fig-m-total-predicted
#| out-width: 65%

knitr::include_graphics("docs/figs/m-total-predicted-3.png")
```

@fig-m-total-predicted shows the predicted total number of letters per
year by whether a legislator is a member of the president's party and whether they are a chair (comparing predictions for counterfactuals
where the same legislator did and did not receive a chair position in
their sixth year).[^6] For an average member in our data, a chair position causes an increase from about 90 to about 115 requests per year, regardless of whether the president is a co-partisan. 

[^6]: Predictions are based on a legislator-agency pair where (1) the
    legislators' average annual contacts equaled the overall average,
    (2) the legislators' number of contacts with the agency equals the
    average received by that agency, (3) and the agency received an
    average number of letters.

The findings in @tbl-models-total are robust to alternative
specifications and measures of the dependent variable. For example, we
might be concerned that exceptionally productive legislators drive the
results. The fourth column shows we obtain the same findings if we use
$\log (Y_{ijt} + 1)$ in our difference-in-differences specification.
Further, our results are not due to differential attrition. The third
column shows that we obtain nearly identical results if we restrict our
analysis to legislators who served beyond one term.

The results in @tbl-models-total show that when legislators acquire more power, they make more requests of agencies.  We now turn to the effect of experience: how does a district's overall representation change after a new legislator replaces an experienced legislator?


## The Effect of Electing a New Representative {#sec-district}

@sec-capacity demonstrated that acquiring institutional power gives legislators the capacity to contact agencies more. This section shows similar capacity effects as they gain experience in the institution.  Rather than examining changes in the number of requests by making
within-legislator comparisons, we now make within-district comparisons
to assess how electing a new legislator affects the total number of
requests a district's representative makes. Within-district comparisons enable us to assess the costs or benefits of
electing a new representative compared to an incumbent.

Even without the aid of statistical models, we can see effects in the raw counts of requests on behalf of a district before and after a new legislator replaces a more experienced legislator. 
For example, @fig-wi shows the change in
contacts from legislators representing Wisconsin's 7th district in the
House (top) and the Senate (bottom). Consistent with the pattern shown in cross-sectional and difference-in-difference designs
described below, newly-elected Representative Sean Duffy initially
provided less constituency service than twenty-term Representative Dave
Obey but was on par with Obey's average number of contacts by year
three. Indeed, the only year in our data with fewer contacts from the
representative of Wisconsin's 7th district than the average member of
the House (the dotted line in the top panel of @fig-wi) was
Representative Duffy's first year in Congress. @fig-wi shows similar
dips in the level of service in the transition from Senator
Feingold to Senator Johnson and from Senator Kohl to Senator Baldwin.


```{r}
#| fig-cap: "The Effect of Electing New Legislators in Wisconsin on Total Requests to Federal Agencies"

#| label: fig-wi
#| out-width: 80%

knitr::include_graphics("figs/districts/(WI-07).png")
knitr::include_graphics("figs/districts/(WI).png")

```

To make this type of district-level comparison systematically, we change
the level of our analysis from the legislator to the district and focus
now on the number of contacts made from the representative of a
particular state or district $i$ in a year $t$, $Y_{it}$. We again use a
difference-in-differences approach to account for district-specific
characteristics and over-time changes in the number of requests legislators make. Specifically, we estimate regressions of the form:

$$\begin{aligned}
Y_{it} & = & \beta_{1}\text{New Member}_{it} + \sum_{s = 2}^{6} \beta_{s} \text{tenure}_{s[it]} + \gamma_{i} + \delta_{t} + \epsilon_{it}  
\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-district1}

$\gamma_{i}$ is a district-specific fixed effect that accounts for each
district's particular demographic characteristics, along with average levels
of demand from district residents. $\delta_{t}$ is a year fixed effect
that controls for common shocks. Our key result of interest,
$\beta_{1}$, is the effect of a district electing a new representative.
To understand how the effect of a new representative changes over time,
we estimate district-level differences for a legislator's second
($\beta_{2}$) through sixth-year ($\beta_{6})$.[^7] (Seven or more years is the reference category.)

[^7]: Despite showing nearly identical results, within-district analysis differs fundamentally from within-legislator analysis. In each election, each district allows its incumbent to acquire another term or replaces them. This differs from within-legislator comparisons
    because legislators can only acquire more tenure or leave the
    chamber. A within-legislator analysis estimates the service provided
    by incumbents with more or less experience; it cannot estimate the
    impact of the choice of an incumbent versus a new representative.
    

#### Electoral Turnover Has Costs

When districts elect a new representative or senator, people in the district experience a sharp decrease in requests made on their behalf. Rather
than experienced legislators forgetting about their districts, our
evidence suggests that newly elected legislators experience substantial
start-up costs and struggle to provide the levels of service that
experienced legislators deliver to their constituents.

Model 1 is a cross-sectional comparison excluding district fixed effects. The second column is a district x year difference in differences model. Column 3 is the difference in differences model subsetted to U.S. House districts only.  Column 3 shows the difference in differences model subsetted to U.S. Senate delegations only.")) 

beta <- round(beta)
```

The first column of @tbl-models-district provides cross-sectional
differences across districts represented by a new member and legislators
in their first six years in office (@eq-district1 minus the district
fixed effect, $\gamma_{i}$). Districts represented by new legislators
receive substantially lower levels of service. On average,
districts with a new representative have 35 fewer
requests made on their behalf. The magnitude of this difference shrinks
for districts represented by legislators in their second year (29
fewer requests). It then reaches a relatively
stable number for districts represented by legislators in their third
through sixth years.

To account for differences in district demographics and demand
for service, Column 2 of @tbl-models-district provides the
estimated effects from the difference-in-differences specification from
@eq-district1. In this specification, we see a large causal effect of a
new member taking over: electing a new member causes the number of requests on behalf of a given district to **decrease by about 40%**, or `r -beta$new_member |> round()` letters per year
(95-percent confidence interval [`r beta$new_member-1.96*se$new_member`, `r beta$new_member+1.96*se$new_member`]).

The effect of electing a new representative, however, dissipates
quickly. Districts have significantly fewer requests made on their behalf when represented by a legislator in their second year, but not as drastic as the difference observed in the first year. After the second year, the differences are smaller. This phenomenon---new
legislators providing substantially fewer requests---persists when
examining the House (Column 3) and the Senate (Column 4) separately. In
short, new legislators make fewer contacts for their constituents than more
experienced legislators.

For each model in @tbl-models-district, @fig-m-district-predicted shows
the predicted total number of letters per district per year by whether a
district is represented by a new legislator (compared to counterfactuals
where the same legislator has been serving for seven or more years).[^8]

## The Effect of Experience and Institutional Power on Legislator *Priorities* {#sec-priority}

To assess legislators' ratio of constituency service to policy work, we
use the `r n2007_2020coded` hand-coded requests described in @sec-data. The dependent variable is the number of constituency service requests divided by the number of policy requests per legislator per year.  These
models test whether legislators' priorities shift among goals as they
gain experience and power. Otherwise, they are the same as @eq-diff1.

While the ratio of constituency service to policy work is conditional on
the levels of each, the inference we make about the ratio does not
depend on these levels; we are not using the ratio to infer the level
(e.g., that a lower share of constituency service means a lower level).
Instead, our theory regarding prioritization is about the ratio,
regardless of the level. 
<!--
Levels may interact with the ratio, but not in
ways that do not mean the same thing for our theory, i.e., that legislators
prioritize one thing over the other.

### Constituent Service is a Smaller Proportion of the Work of Experienced and Powerful Legislators

@tbl-models-ratio shows that legislators decrease the ratio of constituency service to policy
work as they obtain experience and powerful positions in Congress.  The first column of @tbl-models-ratio shows how the
ratio differs *across* legislators with different committee positions.
Column 2 of @tbl-models-ratio provides the estimated effects from the
difference-in-differences specification. We estimate that becoming a
committee chair causes the ratio of constituency service to policy work
to decrease by `r -beta$chair` (95-percent confidence interval [`r beta$chair-1.96*se$chair`, `r beta$chair+1.96*se$chair`]). Becoming a
ranking member causes the ratio to decrease by `r -beta$ranking_minority` (95-percent confidence interval [`r beta$ranking_minority-1.96*se$ranking_minority`, `r beta$ranking_minority+1.96*se$ranking_minority`]).

@fig-m-ratio-predicted shows the predicted ratio of constituency service
to policy work. Subfigure *a* shows predictions by committee chair status and whether that member has a
co-partisan president. We estimate chair effects for our most senior category of
"7 or more years" (a plausible time for acquiring a chair position).
Subfigure *b* shows predictions for counterfactuals where the same legislator did and did not receive a chair position in their sixth year. There is a significant difference when members gain a committee chair position or four or more years of experience. Notably, whether a member has a co-partisan president does not cause a significant difference.

Taken together, these findings about how the ratio of constituency service to policy work varies across legislators show that as legislators acquire more power and experience, their contacts with the bureaucracy become more policy-focused. 

## Experienced and Powerful Legislators Maintain Levels of Constituency Service, While Also Prioritizing Policy Work {#sec-joint}

Increasing capacity and shifting priorities are not mutually exclusive. When legislators acquire capacity, they make more requests of federal agencies. At the same time, higher-capacity legislators allocate a larger share of their efforts toward policy work. That is, we found support for both theories.
In this section, we show that the net result of these two simultaneous effects from 2007 to 2020 was that more experienced and powerful legislators did not decrease their *levels* of constituency service, even though they allocated a larger *share* of their attention towards policy.    

```{r}
load(here::here("models", "models_con.Rdata"))
```

In Table 3 of the Supplementary Information, we use our hand-coding of agency contacts to assess how legislators' levels of constituency service requests change as their capacity changes.  Using the same difference-in-differences specification as in Model 2 of @tbl-models-total, we find that a given **legislator** who becomes committee chair makes an additional `r beta$chair |> round()` constituency service contacts per agency per year, an increase that is not statistically significant (95 percent confidence interval [`r beta$chair-se$chair*1.96`, `r beta$chair+se$chair*1.96`]).  All models in Table 4 of the Supplementary Information show significant increases in policy work as a legislator gains experience or a committee leadership position.


<!---WHY IS DO WE NEED THIS PARAGRAPH?--> 
<!--
```{r}
load(here::here("models", "models_policy.Rdata"))
```

In contrast, in Table 4 of the Supplementary Information, we find using the same difference-in-difference model that becoming a committee chairperson causes  `r beta$chair`  additional policy contacts per agency per year (95 percent confidence interval [`r beta$chair-se$chair*1.96`, `r beta$chair+se$chair*1.96`]), a statistically significant difference compared to the constituency service increase [-0.00, 0.28].^[We fail to detect an effect of becoming a ranking member or joining a prestige committee for constituency service while detecting an effect for policy work.  That said, we fail to reject the null of a difference in the change in rates of constituency service and policy work for legislators who join prestige committees or become a ranking member.  We find first-year legislators make fewer constituency service and policy work requests.]  
--> 

```{r}
load(here::here("models", "models_district_con.Rdata"))
```

Similarly, in Table 5 of the Supplementary Information, we use our hand-coding of agency contacts to assess how the level of constituency service requests coming from a given **district** changes when a new member is elected. Using the same difference-in-differences specification as in Model 2 of @tbl-models-district, we find that electing a new member causes a significant decrease in the level of constituency service. When a district replaces an experienced member with a new legislator, we estimate `r -beta$new_member |> round()` fewer *constituency service* contacts per year (95 percent confidence interval [`r beta$new_member-se$new_member*1.96`, `r beta$new_member+se$new_member*1.96`]). All models in Table 6 of the Supplementary Information show significant decreases in policy work done on behalf of a district persisting for at least five years after a new legislator replaces an experienced legislator.

In short, the "shifting priorities" effects were insufficiently large to overpower the "increasing capacity" effects to cause an overall decrease in constituency service among longer-serving or more powerful legislators. Instead, **districts that replaced an experienced legislator with a new legislator saw a significant decrease in both policy work *and* constituency service** for at least two years. The capacity effects overcame the effects of shifting priorities, meaning that longer-serving legislators did more constituency service, not less. <!--We can see that from these two sets of analyses by recalling that in the difference-in-difference specification of our level analysis (Model 2 of Table 2), we found that becoming a committee chair causes an increase of 0.29 requests per agency (95 percent confidence interval [0.12,0.47]). Across all 92 agencies, this represents an increase of approximately 27 additional requests per year.
--> <!--TODO INSERT EVIDENCE FOR THIS --> 

<!--However, as we discuss further in @sec-discussion, the total number of constituency service requests does not drop, even as the proportion of constituency service-related requests decreases. -->

# The Effects of Demand for Constituency Service {#sec-demand}

While constituent demand affects the level of constituency service legislators provide, demand-side shifts do not appear to explain the within-legislator or within-district variation we observe with changing committee positions and longer tenure in Congress.
Constituent demand does not shift
among legislators in ways we would expect to see if shifting
constituent demand explained the within-legislator or within-district
variation shown in @sec-results.

## District Characteristics Affect the Provision of Constituency Service

We find that population size correlates with the overall number of legislator requests. 
<!--The characteristics of their districts also correlate with which agencies legislators contact.  For example, a one percentage point increase in the proportion of residents who are veterans is associated with an increase of about .84 constituency service requests to the Department of Veterans Affairs. A one percentage point increase in the proportion of residents over 65 is associated with an increase of an additional 0.03 requests made to the Social Security Administration--> 
These correlations provide face validity for our measures of legislator behavior, but they also suggest that cross-sectional comparisons may conflate legislator choices with district characteristics. 
<!--Given this potential confounding, our models above leveraged within-district and within-agency variation.-->

We expect senators who represent larger states to make more requests.
Senators from larger states have a larger number of constituents to
serve, and they receive a larger budget to handle that increase in
requests. @fig-stateSize shows this is the case: senators from
larger states provide more service on average. 
While the number of legislator requests is associated with population size, @fig-stateSize also shows significant variation in
the level of service senators provide, even among states of similar
sizes.

## Do Voters Demand More of More Powerful Legislators?

Can variation in demand for constituency service explain why legislators increas contacts with agencies when they gain experience and committee leadership positions?

We limited the influence of demand when assessing how power and
experience affect the levels of constituency service above. For example,
our empirical strategies in @sec-results all account for demand based on the characteristics of the district. Because our
analyses include either legislator-agency or district fixed effects, we
compare how the levels of constituency service change, holding constant
demand related to fixed district characteristics. Furthermore, demand
generated by legislators is plausibly part of the
increased constituency service that we attribute to increased capacity and experience.

Yet, we might expect that a legislator's experience or power could
affect constituency demand, even without legislators using their
increased capacity and resources to generate demand. For example,
constituents could direct their demands to legislators who are
more powerful or who have served longer. This section
investigates whether such shifts in constituent demand could plausibly
explain our results. We find no evidence that higher
constituent demand drives experienced members' higher levels of
constituency service.

Suppose constituents
shift demand based on legislator experience (as required for constituent
demand to explain our results). In that case, we should observe them redirecting 
demands away from newly elected legislators toward other
representatives. The most plausible target for these constituent demands
would be one of the senators representing the constituent's state. While
less plausible, if a new senator replaces a more senior senator, demand
could also shift to more senior members of the House.

To assess whether constituents redirect demand toward other, more
experienced legislators when new members replace their more experienced
incumbent representative, we examine how experienced legislators' levels
of constituency service change in response to having new representatives
in their state.  Using district and year fixed effects, we estimate a series of difference-in-differences regressions
where the treatment is new members in the state. Because we are interested in assessing
whether constituents with new legislators direct their constituency
service demands to more experienced legislators, we restrict the regression to incumbents. 
Because House members generally do not provide constituency service to people outside their district, we measure
the effect of a new Senator in a state delegation. For Senators, we measure new members in the state in two ways: either the proportion of a
state delegation that is new or an indicator of whether there is a new
legislator (House or Senate) in the delegation. As in
@sec-district, we measure the number of requests a district's
representative makes in a particular year. Since we aim to test whether constituent demand drives our results, @tbl-models-spillover shows estimates using requests hand-coded as constituency service. The results for total requests are nearly identical (see Supplemental Information).

```

The first column of @tbl-models-spillover estimates the effect of an
a new Senator replacing an experienced Senator on all other
incumbent legislators from the state, with no significant effect on the level of constituency service that other legislators provide.
Columns 2 and 3 of @tbl-models-spillover focus only on Senators. They show that either a new member in the delegation or the proportion of new members does not increase incumbents' constituency service (indeed, we see a statistically significant decrease in model 3). This consistent null or negative impact of new legislators in a state delegation provides reassurance that there is no evidence of constituents redirecting demand toward other, more experienced legislators in response to having new representatives in their state delegation.

# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

Most legislator contacts with federal agencies focus on constituency
service. While there is massive inequality in the quantity of service
that different members provide, we show that this is not the result of
long-serving members devoting less attention to their district over
time, as the "Potomac Fever" hypothesis suggests. Legislators prioritize policy work as they acquire positions of institutional power. However, simultaneous increases in capacity that
come with experience and institutional power more than offset shifting
priorities, such that the district constituency receives no less
particularistic service from long-serving and powerful legislators.

## Implications for Theory

Our finding that shifts in capacity and priorities simultaneously affect
contacts with agencies imply that scholars of legislator behavior
should focus both on the levels of effort legislators provide and how
they divide that effort. Legislator requests to the bureaucracy are one
of many types of behavior that are likely affected by simultaneous
changes in capacity and priorities. In addition to correspondence with
federal agencies, the volume of legislative work, oversight reports, or
hearings produced by a legislator's office depend both on their
capacity to do that work and the relative priority of each task.

Further, our findings suggest that the mechanisms we
suggest---organizational efficiency, office resources, and likelihood
of success---may help explain legislator behavior. The dramatic decrease in
both constituent and policy work when new legislators take office is consistent with the
organizational efficiency mechanism. Becoming a committee chair
increases the resources available to a legislator and their volume of
work with federal agencies. Both results are consistent with
legislators making more requests to federal agencies when they are
likely to perceive greater rewards.

Elected officials continue to dedicate substantial
resources to constituency service well into their careers and after achieving high-status institutional positions. This evidence that constituency service is a core function of congressional offices calls for renewed attention to the motivations for and effects of
constituency service in contemporary American politics. As we collected and coded
these data, we spoke to numerous staffers and agency officials. 
A recurring theme in the data and stories we heard was how constituency service casework led to other activities, including oversight investigations and legislation. 
Moreover, our data show new legislation leading to new forms of constituency service as legislators
helped their constituents attain newly legislated benefits, deal with
new paperwork requirements, or avoid new regulatory requirements.
While constituency service may have underlying electoral motivations, as
formal models suggest, it is also a prominent yet understudied form of
legislator behavior in its own right.

Our finding that experience and institutional power allow legislators to
do more policy work while maintaining levels of constituent service
complements recent scholarship on legislator behavior. The same legislators
who @Grose2011, @Dinesen2021, @LowandeRitchieLauterbach2018, and others
find doing more casework for minority groups also likely to do more
policy work on behalf of those groups (in line with @Mendez2018) and
higher rates of advocacy for nonprofits that serve those groups. While
legislators must prioritize limited time [@Kaslovsky2022], institutional
power increases the capacity of a legislative office to
pursue both policy work and constituency service. Because institutional
power comes with resources, representation matters not just in Congress
but also in powerful positions like committee chairs.

## Implications for Policy

The large effects of legislator capacity that we find add to a recent wave of scholarship on the impact of congressional staffing. @LaPira2020
document many effects that decreasing staffing levels may have on the
functioning of Congress. Because increased staff for committee chairs is
a likely mechanism for the capacity effects we find, our results offer a
key outcome measure and effect sizes that may correspond to additional
staff. While committee chairs simultaneously obtain other forms of power
like agenda control, to the extent that our results reflect the capacity
boost of committee staff, our evidence suggests that congressional staff
likely have measurable and potentially large effects on the volume of
work legislators can do.

Advocates for term limits often argue that elected officials lose touch
with their district. In contrast, we show that more experienced
legislators provide as much or more service to their district, even as
they do more policy work. Moreover, our results show that new
legislators have less capacity to make requests to federal agencies.
Removing experienced legislators would likely decrease levels of
constituency service.

## Future Research {#sec-future} 

<!--NOTE: prose could be better--> 
While we've focused on understanding the impact of experience and institutional power in this paper, many questions remain ripe for future research. On this same topic, future research should delve into the mechanisms by which
increasing experience and capacity shape legislator behavior. This could
include explicit measures of office organization and efficiency and more
nuanced measures of institutional power. This could also include
measuring agency responsiveness to legislator requests. Likewise,
research could examine mechanisms related to shifting priorities.

Perhaps the most pressing question is explaining the massive inequities in legislators' provision of service and policy work we found. This variation is even greater than can be explained by the substantively large effects of experience and power, suggesting that the "service-policy divide" [@ButlerKarpowitzPope2012] offers an incomplete picture of how legislators use their capacity. Why do some legislators provide so much constituency service and others so little?  

Finally, future work could include legislators' substantive areas of
expertise. Does expertise increase a legislator's capacity to act in
certain areas (e.g., certain agencies), leading to more capacity for
constituency service? Does increased institutional power lead
legislators to develop expertise, for example, in certain committee work
or specialized policy work that builds their capacity to influence
certain agencies?

The new dataset we introduce here will help scholars answer
these questions. Critically, our systematic approach to data collection allows more
general tests of legislator behavior. Any sample focusing on a few
policy domains or agencies will over-represent legislators sitting on
certain oversight committees and representing certain constituencies.
Our near-census of legislator contacts minimizes such confounders and
will allow researchers to test more general theories of legislator
behavior, as we have done here.

<!---
advance the study of descriptive
representation, expanding on work by @LowandeRitchieLauterbach2018, who
find that women, minority, and veteran members do more casework on
behalf of groups that share their identity. The new data we collect will
allow similar tests of representation for other demographic groups,
including seniors, farmers, and low-income populations, to name just a
few. Likewise, more data will allow new tests of prior work showing that
members use lobbying the bureaucracy to advance policy goals when they
conflict with their party's agenda [@Ritchie2017]. Our systematic data
allow tests of variation across policy domains and government functions.

# Conclusion {#sec-conclude}

As legislators gain experience and power, they shift their priorities
to policy work. Simultaneously, they gain institutional positions that increase their capacity to make more requests to federal agencies.
Consistent with our theory that experience
increases capacity, we also show that legislators make fewer
requests at the start of their careers. New legislators do
substantially less constituency service and policy work than their more experienced
colleagues. Crucially, for the period we study, the increase in capacity was large enough
relative to the shift in attention toward policy work that legislators
maintained or even increased levels of constituency service as they gained
institutional power. Voters do not face a trade-off between powerful and attentive representatives.
